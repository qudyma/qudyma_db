            "summary": "We study a type of solitonic Andreev bound state (ABS) in a Corbino-geometry Josephson junction created on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The Josephson junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The mismatch produces a Josephson vortex (phase soliton) that binds unconventional spinful but chargeless ABSs, analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi solitonic states. The position around the Josephson junction of the trapped ABSs can be controlled externally by a junction phase bias. As the solitonic ABSs are shuttled around the Josephson junction, the 2DEG spin-orbit coupling induces a geometric precession of their spin. We argue that these solitonic ABSs constitute a natural candidate for a type of superconducting Andreev spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. Holonomic single-qubit SASQ operations are induced through soliton shuttling, with the resulting SU(2) trajectories densely covering the qubit Bloch sphere. Effects of disorder, nonholonomic SASQ dynamics, and other aspects of qubit operation are also analyzed.",

            "summary": "Abstract\n                Today’s information processing technology relies on electronics, with transistor switches reaching speeds as high as 800 GHz yet appearing to approach their intrinsic limits set by charge carrier transit times. The next disruptive step towards increasing the speed of information processing could come from driving the electronic response in solids with ultrafast controlled lightwaves. This lightwave electronics aims to use ultrashort pulses of light to switch electric currents and can potentially operate at nearly PHz rates. Lightwave valleytronics targets a new degree of freedom for information processing offered by two-dimensional materials: the valley pseudospin. Here we use a sequence of phase-locked few-optical-cycle visible pulses to excite and switch the valley pseudospin in a WS2 monolayer. By timing the carrier oscillations with sub-femtosecond precision, we show that a  pair of pulses separated in time with linear orthogonal polarizations can induce a valley selective population. Adding a second pair of pulses, we perform logic operations such as valley de-excitation and re-excitation at room temperature at rates as high as ∼ 10 THz. Our experimental method also allows independent measurement of the valley polarization decay and the excitonic decoherence time. Our work opens a new route for ultrafast information processing with low-power few-optical-cycle light pulses available today.",

However, their role in the nonlinear response to intense, nonresonant, low-frequency light is often overlooked as strong fields are expected to tear the electron-hole pair apart. Using high-harmonic generation as a spectroscopic tool, we theoretically study their formation and role in the nonlinear optical response. We show that the excitonic contribution is prominent and that excitons remain stable even when the driving laser field surpasses the strength of the Coulomb field binding the electron-hole pair. We demonstrate a parallel between the behavior of strongly laser-driven excitons in 2D solids and strongly driven Rydberg states in atoms, including the mechanisms of their formation and stability. Last, we show how the excitonic contribution can be singled out by encapsulating the 2D material in a dielectric, tuning the excitonic energy and its contribution to the high-harmonic spectrum.",

The electrical tunability of this phase makes it an ideal platform to investigate unique topological effects at zero magnetic field, such as topological superconductivity. Here we couple the helical edges of such a heterostructure to a superconductor. The inversion of the bulk gap accompanied by helical states near zero displacement field leads to the suppression of the critical current in a Josephson geometry. Using superconducting quantum interferometry we observe an even-odd effect in the Fraunhofer interference pattern within the inverted gap phase. We show theoretically that this effect is a direct consequence of the emergence of helical modes that connect the two edges of the sample. The absence of such an effect at high displacement field, as well as in bare bilayer graphene junctions, supports this interpretation and demonstrates the topological nature of the inverted gap.",

            "summary": "The search for robust topological superconductivity and Majorana bound states continues, exploring both one-dimensional (1D) systems such as semiconducting nanowires and two-dimensional (2D) platforms. In this work we study a 2D approach based on graphene bilayers encapsulated in transition metal dichalcogenides that, unlike previous proposals involving the Quantum Hall regime in graphene, requires weaker magnetic fields and does not rely on interactions. The encapsulation induces strong spin-orbit coupling on the graphene bilayer, which opens a sizeable gap and stabilizes fragile pairs of helical edge states. We show that, when subject to an in-plane Zeeman field, armchair edges can be transformed into p-wave one-dimensional topological superconductors by contacting them laterally with conventional superconductors. We demonstrate the emergence of Majorana bound states (MBSs) at the sample corners of crystallographically perfect flakes, belonging either to the D or the BDI symmetry classes depending on parameters. We compute the phase diagram, the resilience of MBSs against imperfections, and their manifestation as a 4\n                    \n                      \n                        \\pi\n                        \n                          π\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                    -periodic effect in Josephson junction geometries, all suggesting the existence of a topological phase within experimental reach.",

In semiconductor–superconductor heterostructures, this feature may also be caused by the topologically trivial Andreev bound states. Valentini\n            et al.\n            provide comprehensive evidence that the ZBPs observed in their experiments with semiconductor nanowires fully coated with a superconducting shell are indeed of this topologically trivial origin, in contrast to the interpretation of similar earlier experiments.

This surprising fact has been used to challenge the interpretation of various transport experiments in terms of Majorana zero modes. Here we show that the Andreev versus Majorana controversy is clarified when framed in the language of non-Hermitian topology, the natural description for quantum systems open to the environment. This change of paradigm allows one to understand topological transitions and the emergence of zero modes in more general systems than can be described by band topology. This is achieved by studying exceptional point bifurcations in the complex spectrum of the system’s non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Within this broader topological classification, Majoranas from both conventional band topology and a large subset of Andreev levels at zero energy are in fact topologically equivalent, which explains why they cannot be distinguished.",

            "summary": "AbstractThe discovery of topologically nontrivial electronic systems has opened a new age in condensed matter research. From topological insulators to topological superconductors and Weyl semimetals, it is now understood that some of the most remarkable and robust phases in electronic systems (e.g., quantum Hall or anomalous quantum Hall) are the result of topological protection. These powerful ideas have recently begun to be explored also in bosonic systems. Topologically protected acoustic, mechanical, and optical edge states have been demonstrated in a number of systems that recreate the requisite topological conditions. Such states that propagate without backscattering could find important applications in communications and energy technologies. Here, a topologically bound mechanical state, a different class of nonpropagating protected state that cannot be destroyed by local perturbations, is demonstrated. It is in particular a mechanical analogue of the well‐known Majorana bound states (MBSs) of electronic topological superconductor systems. The topological binding is implemented by creating a Kekulé distortion vortex on a 2D mechanical honeycomb superlattice that can be mapped to a magnetic flux vortex in a topological superconductor.",

            "summary": "AbstractThe Josephson effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon where a dissipationless supercurrent is introduced in a weak link between two superconducting electrodes by Andreev reflections. The physical details and topology of the junction drastically modify the properties of the supercurrent and a strong enhancement of the critical supercurrent is expected to occur when the topology of the junction allows an emergence of Majorana bound states. Here we report charge transport measurements in mesoscopic Josephson junctions formed by InAs nanowires and Ti/Al superconducting leads. Our main observation is a colossal enhancement of the critical supercurrent induced by an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the substrate. This striking and anomalous supercurrent enhancement cannot be described by any known conventional phenomenon of Josephson junctions. We consider these results in the context of topological superconductivity, and show that the observed critical supercurrent enhancement is compatible with a magnetic field-induced topological transition.",

This ideal situation is, however, hard to achieve in physical implementations, such as proximitized semiconducting nanowires of realistic length. In such systems Majorana overlaps are unavoidable and lead to their hybridization into charged Bogoliubov quasiparticles of finite energy, which, unlike true zero modes, are affected by electronic interactions. We here demonstrate that these interactions, particularly with bound charges in the dielectric surroundings, drastically change the non-interacting paradigm. Remarkably, interactions may completely suppress Majorana hybridization around parity crossings, where the total charge in the nanowire changes. This effect, dubbed zero-energy pinning, stabilizes Majoranas back to zero energy and charge, and leads to electronically incompressible parameter regions wherein Majoranas remain insensitive to local perturbations, despite their overlap.",

The possibility to consider the electronic states from a tight-binding model is highly useful for the calculation of many physical properties, for which first principle calculations are more demanding in computational terms when having a large number of atoms. Here, we present a set of Slater–Koster parameters for a tight-binding model that accurately reproduce the structure and the orbital character of the valence and conduction bands of single layer MX     2    , where     M =     Mo, W and     X =     S, Se. The fit of the analytical tight-binding Hamiltonian is done based on band structure from ab initio calculations.

Here we demonstrate an alternative route, which achieves fully localised zero-energy Majorana bound states when a topologically trivial superconductor is strongly coupled to a helical normal region. Such a junction can be experimentally realised by e.g. proximitizing a finite section of a nanowire with spin-orbit coupling and combining electrostatic depletion and a Zeeman field to drive the non-proximitized (normal) portion into a helical phase. Majorana zero modes emerge in such an open system without fine-tuning as a result of charge-conjugation symmetry and can be ultimately linked to the existence of ‘exceptional points’ (EPs) in parameter space, where two quasibound Andreev levels bifurcate into two quasibound Majorana zero modes. After the EP, one of the latter becomes non-decaying as the junction approaches perfect Andreev reflection, thus resulting in a Majorana dark state (MDS) localised at the NS junction. We show that MDSs exhibit the full range of properties associated to conventional closed-system Majorana bound states (zero-energy, self-conjugation, 4π-Josephson effect and non-Abelian braiding statistics), while not requiring topological superconductivity.",

The interaction strength between neighbouring layers, most easily controlled through their interlayer separation, can have significant influence on the electronic properties of these composite materials. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control over interlayer interactions by locally modifying the interlayer separation between graphene and boron nitride, which we achieve by applying pressure with a scanning tunnelling microscopy tip. For the special case of aligned or nearly-aligned graphene on boron nitride, the graphene lattice can stretch and compress locally to compensate for the slight lattice mismatch between the two materials. We find that modifying the interlayer separation directly tunes the lattice strain and induces commensurate stacking underneath the tip. Our results motivate future studies tailoring the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures by controlling the interlayer separation of the entire device using hydrostatic pressure.",

            "summary": "We study theoretically the local density of states (DOS) in a topological Josephson junction. We show that the well-known 4π Josephson effect originates from the interference effect between two Majorana fermions (MFs) that are localized at the Josephson junction. In addition, the DOS for electrons (holes) shows the 4π interference information along each parity conserved energy spectrum. The DOS displays a 2π period oscillation when two trivial states interfere with each other. This means that the DOS information may be used to distinguish the MFs from trivial localized states. We suggest that the interference effect and the DOS can be detected by using two STM leads or two normal leads. A single side lead can only detect the Andreev reflection tunneling process in the junction, which cannot reveal information about the interference effect in general. However, using two side leads, we can reveal information about the interference effect of the MFs as well as the DOS by combining Andreev reflection with the electron transmission process.",

            "summary": "Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps. In addition, the SM wavefunction spreads all across the section of the nanowire, leading typically to a finite background of trivial subgap states with which MZMs may coexist. To overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs as the SM part of a full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that emerges from the combination of the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction of the SM active shell and the confinement effects of the nanostructure, thus depending mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on red electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry. As a result, core-shell SM hole-band NWs are found to be a promising candidate to explore Majorana physics in full-hell hybrid devices, addressing several challenges in the field.",

Here, we analyze a tripartite SM/FI/SC heterostructure but realized in a planar stacking geometry, where the thin FI layer acts as a spin-polarized barrier between the SM and the SC. We optimize the system’s geometrical parameters using microscopic simulations, finding the range of FI thicknesses for which the hybrid system can be tuned into the topological regime. Within this range, and thanks to the vertical confinement provided by the stacking geometry, trivial and topological phases alternate regularly as the external gate is varied, displaying a hard topological gap that can reach half of the SC one. This is a significant improvement compared to setups using hexagonal nanowires, which show erratic topological regions with typically smaller and softer gaps. Our proposal provides a magnetic field-free planar design for quasi-one-dimensional topological superconductivity with attractive properties for experimental control and scalability.",

            "summary": "AbstractTwo-dimensional layered perovskites are attracting increasing attention as more robust analogues to the conventional three-dimensional metal-halide perovskites for both light harvesting and light emitting applications. However, the impact of the reduced dimensionality on the optoelectronic properties remains unclear, particularly regarding the spatial dynamics of the excitonic excited state within the two-dimensional plane. Here, we present direct measurements of exciton transport in single-crystalline layered perovskites. Using transient photoluminescence microscopy, we show that excitons undergo an initial fast diffusion through the crystalline plane, followed by a slower subdiffusive regime as excitons get trapped. Interestingly, the early intrinsic diffusivity depends sensitively on the choice of organic spacer. A clear correlation between lattice stiffness and diffusivity is found, suggesting exciton–phonon interactions to be dominant in the spatial dynamics of the excitons in perovskites, consistent with the formation of exciton–polarons. Our findings provide a clear design strategy to optimize exciton transport in these systems.",

            "summary": "Hybrid superconductor–semiconductor nanowires with Rashba spin–orbit coupling are arguably becoming the leading platform for the search of Majorana bound states (MBSs) in engineered topological superconductors. We perform a systematic numerical study of the low-energy Andreev spectrum and supercurrents in short and long superconductor–normal–superconductor junctions made of nanowires with strong Rashba spin–orbit coupling, where an external Zeeman field is applied perpendicular to the spin–orbit axis. In particular, we investigate the detailed evolution of the Andreev bound states from the trivial into the topological phase and their relation with the emergence of MBSs. Due to the finite length, the system hosts four MBSs, two at the inner part of the junction and two at the outer one. They hybridize and give rise to a finite energy splitting at a superconducting phase difference of π, a well-visible effect that can be traced back to the evolution of the energy spectrum with the Zeeman field: from the trivial phase with Andreev bound states into the topological phase with MBSs. Similarly, we carry out a detailed study of supercurrents for short and long junctions from the trivial to the topological phases. The supercurrent, calculated from the Andreev spectrum, is 2π-periodic in the trivial and topological phases. In the latter it exhibits a clear sawtooth profile at a phase difference of π when the energy splitting is negligible, signalling a strong dependence of current–phase curves on the length of the superconducting regions. Effects of temperature, scalar disorder and reduction of normal transmission on supercurrents are also discussed. Further, we identify the individual contribution of MBSs. In short junctions the MBSs determine the current–phase curves, while in long junctions the spectrum above the gap (quasi-continuum) introduces an important contribution.",

Ideally, they are non-local states that are charge-neutral superpositions of electrons and holes. However, in nanowires of realistic length their wave functions overlap and acquire a finite charge that makes them susceptible to interactions, specifically with the image charges that arise in the electrostatic environment. Considering a realistic three-dimensional model of the dielectric surroundings, here we show that, under certain circumstances, these interactions lead to a suppression of the Majorana oscillations predicted by simpler theoretical models, and to the formation of low-energy quantum-dot states that interact with the Majorana modes. Both features are observed in recent experiments on the detection of Majoranas and could thus help to properly characterize them.",

We consider a Chern insulator whose topological phase is tuned via a second-order hopping. We perform time-dynamics simulations of the out-of-equilibrium laser-driven electron motion that enables us to model a realistic attosecond spectroscopy scheme. In particular, we use an ultrafast scheme with a circularly polarized IR pump pulse and an attosecond x-ray probe pulse. A laser-induced dichroism-type spectrum shows a clear signature of the topological phase transition. We are able to connect these signatures with the Berry structure of the system. This work extend the applications of attosecond absorption spectroscopy to systems presenting a non-trivial topological phase.",

These are bound states showing up in the band gaps of many-body systems and are conceived as quasiparticles formed by an electron and a hole. By performing real-time simulations in hBN, we show that an ultrashort (few-fs) UV pulse can produce a coherent superposition of excitonic states that induces an oscillatory motion of electrons and holes between different valleys in reciprocal space, leading to a sizeable exciton migration in real space. We also show that an ultrafast spectroscopy scheme based on the absorption of an attosecond pulse in combination with the UV pulse can be used to read out the laser-induced coherences, hence to extract the characteristic time for exciton migration. This work opens the door towards ultrafast electronics and valleytronics adding time as a control knob and exploiting electron coherence at the early times of excitation.",

OTA and tr‐XAS of 1 and 2 show that the favored catalytic pathway involves reductive quenching of the excited photosensitizer and electron transfer to the catalyst to form a CoII square pyramidal intermediate with a bonded aqua molecule followed by a CoI square planar derivative that decays within ≈8 μs. By contrast, a CoI square pyramidal intermediate with a longer decay lifetime of ≈35 μs is formed from an analogous CoII geometry for 3 in H2O. These results highlight the protonation of CoI to form the elusive hydride species to be the rate limiting step and show that the catalytic rate can be enhanced through hydrogen containing pendant amines that act as H−H bond formation proton relays.",

Here we demonstrate the ability to initiate and track the ultrafast electron rearrangement and chemical bond breaking site-specifically in real time for the carbon monoxide diatomic molecule. We employ a local resonant x-ray pump at the oxygen atom and probe the chemical shifts of the carbon core-electron binding energy. We observe charge redistribution accompanying core-excitation followed by Auger decay, eventually leading to dissociation and hole trapping at one site of the molecule. The presented technique is general in nature with sensitivity to chemical environment changes including transient electronic excited state dynamics. This work provides a route to investigate energy and charge transport processes in more complex systems by tracking selective chemical bond changes on their natural timescale.",

            "summary": "Recent developments in attosecond technology led to table-top x-ray spectroscopy in the soft x-ray range, thus uniting the element- and state-specificity of core-level x-ray absorption spectroscopy with the time resolution to follow electronic dynamics in real-time. We describe recent work in attosecond technology and investigations into materials such as Si, SiO2, GaN, Al2O3, Ti, and TiO2, enabled by the convergence of these two capabilities. We showcase the state-of-the-art on isolated attosecond soft x-ray pulses for x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy to observe the 3d-state dynamics of the semi-metal TiS2 with attosecond resolution at the Ti L-edge (460 eV). We describe how the element- and state-specificity at the transition metal L-edge of the quantum material allows us to unambiguously identify how and where the optical field influences charge carriers. This precision elucidates that the Ti:3d conduction band states are efficiently photo-doped to a density of 1.9 × 1021 cm−3. The light-field induces coherent motion of intra-band carriers across 38% of the first Brillouin zone. Lastly, we describe the prospects with such unambiguous real-time observation of carrier dynamics in specific bonding or anti-bonding states and speculate that such capability will bring unprecedented opportunities toward an engineered approach for designer materials with pre-defined properties and efficiency. Examples are composites of semiconductors and insulators like Si, Ge, SiO2, GaN, BN, and quantum materials like graphene, transition metal dichalcogens, or high-Tc superconductors like NbN or LaBaCuO. Exiting are prospects to scrutinize canonical questions in multi-body physics, such as whether the electrons or lattice trigger phase transitions.",

Tr‐XAS analysis after light illumination shows the formation of a seven‐coordinated high‐spin quintet metastable state, which relaxes to a six‐coordinated high‐spin configuration before decaying to the ground state. Kinetic analysis of the macrocyclic complex reveals an unprecedented long‐lived decay lifetime of approximately 42.6 μs. Comparative studies with a non‐macrocyclic counterpart illustrate a significantly shortened approximately 568‐fold decay lifetime of about 75 ns, and highlight the importance of the ligand arrangement in stabilizing the reactivity of the excited state. Lastly, OTA analysis shows the seven‐coordinated high‐spin state to be formed within approximately 6.2 ps. These findings provide a complete understanding of the spin crossover reaction and relaxation pathways of the macrocyclic complex, and reveal the importance of a flexible coordination environment for their rational design.",

The extended nature of the molecular potential implies the separation of some of the molecular sites from the edge of the ionization barrier. We show that the dependence of the tunnel probability with the distance to the barrier is translated into the ionized wavepacket, modifying substantially the high-order harmonic emission. The introduction of the dependence of tunnel ionization with the molecular site significantly improves the theoretical description of high-order harmonic generation in molecules, which is used as a cornerstone in high-harmonic spectroscopy and attosecond imaging.",

Time‐resolved X‐ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X‐ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis enabled the elucidation of the electronic and structural configuration of the copper center in the excited state as well as its decay dynamics in different solvent conditions with and without triethylamine acting as a sacrificial electron donor. A three‐fold decrease in the decay lifetime of the excited state is observed in the presence of triethylamine, showing the feasibility of the reductive quenching pathway in the latter case. A prominent pre‐edge feature is observed in the XANES spectrum of the excited state upon metal to charge ligand transfer transition, showing an increased hybridization of the 3d states with the ligand p orbitals in the tetrahedron around the Cu center. EXAFS and density functional theory illustrate a significant shortening of the Cu−N and an elongation of the Cu−P bonds together with a decrease in the torsional angle between the xantphos and bathocuproine ligand. This study provides mechanistic time‐resolved understanding for the development of improved heteroleptic CuI photosensitizers, which can be used for the light‐driven production of hydrogen from water.",

These vortices have many applications in the optical regime, ranging from optical trapping and quantum information to spectroscopy and microscopy. The extension of vortices into the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV)/X-ray regime constitutes a significant step forward to bring those applications to the nanometer or even atomic scale. The recent development of a new generation of X-ray sources, and the refinement of other techniques, such as harmonic generation, have boosted the interest of producing vortex beams at short wavelengths. In this manuscript, we review the recent studies in the subject, and we collect the major prospects of this emerging field. We also focus on the unique and promising applications of ultrashort XUV/X-ray vortex pulses.",

Recently, OAM has been imprinted to short-wavelength radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), leading to the emission of attosecond twisted beams in the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) regime. We explore the details of the mapping of the driving vortex to its harmonic spectrum. In particular, we show that the geometry of the harmonic vortices is convoluted, arising from the superposition of the contribution from the short and long quantum paths responsible of HHG. Finally, we show how to take advantage of transverse phase-matching to select twisted attosecond beams with different spatiotemporal properties.",

To this end, we drive high-order harmonic generation with infrared conical refraction (CR) beams. We show that the high-order harmonic beams emitted in the EUV/soft x-ray regime preserve the characteristic signatures of the driving beam, namely ringlike transverse intensity profile and CR-like polarization distribution. As a result, through orbital and spin angular momentum conservation, harmonic beams are emitted with fractional orbital angular momentum, and they can be synthesized into structured attosecond helical beams –or “structured attosecond light springs”– with rotating linear polarization along the azimuth. Our proposal overcomes the state of the art limitations for the generation of light beams far from the visible domain carrying non-integer orbital angular momentum and could be applied in fields such as diffraction imaging, EUV lithography, particle trapping, and super-resolution imaging.",

The Xe 3d-ϵf continuum shape resonances dominate the photoionization cross sections of both the atom and molecule, but prominent resonances appear in the XeF2 cross section due to nominal excitation of Xe 3d and F 1s electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), a delocalized anti-bonding MO. Comparisons of the ion products from the atom and molecule following Xe 3d photoionization show that the charge-state distribution of Xe ions is shifted to lower charge states in the molecule along with production of energetic F+ and F2+ ions. This suggests that, in decay of a Xe 3d core hole, charge is redistributed to the F ligands and the system dissociates due to Coulomb repulsion. The ion products from excitation of the F 1s-LUMO resonance are different and show strong increases in the yields of Xe+ and F+ ions. The subshell ionization thresholds, the LUMO resonance energies, and their oscillator strengths are calculated by relativistic coupled-cluster methods and agree well with measurements.",

            "summary": "High-harmonic generation from solids can be utilized as a probe of ultrafast dynamics, but thus far only over extended sample areas, since its spatial resolution is diffraction limited. Here, we propose spatial polarization gating, that is, using a spatially varying ellipticity of a driving laser pulse to reduce the spatial profile of high-harmonic emission below the diffraction limit and hence increase spatial resolution. We show experimentally and by numerical simulations that our method is generally applicable as suppressing high harmonics in elliptical fields is a common response in all solids. We also briefly explore the possibility of applying this technique to wide-field imaging, specifically to nonlinear structured illumination microscopy. Our findings indicate that spatial polarization gating can enable all-optical femto-to-attosecond label-free imaging beyond the Abbe limit.",

Due to the Wannier-Stark localization induced on subcycle timescales in the presence of a strong field, real-space descriptions are natural for strongly driven solids. Our approach allows us to address the origin of the extremely short dephasing times, which appear necessary for agreement between experimental HHG measurements and theoretical calculations generally performed in reciprocal space. We develop a physically transparent model of real-space dephasing which relates its rate to the distance between different sites in a laser-driven lattice. Our approach leads to well-structured high harmonic spectra at the microscopic level, reproduces the results of macroscopic propagation, and demonstrates that the requirement for ultrafast dephasing times stems from the need for suppressing recombination events with large electron-hole separations during radiative recombination.\n          \n            \n            \n              \n                Published by the American Physical Society\n                2024",

We find that far-field propagation naturally reduces the contribution to the observed HHG emission from electrons that do not return to the lattice site where they have been injected into the conduction band. We then show that extremely short dephasing times routinely used in microscopic simulations suppress many electron trajectories that contribute to the far-field spectra, leading to significant distortions of the true high harmonic response. We show that a real-space based dephasing mechanism, which preferentially suppresses trajectories that veer too far away from their original lattice site, yields HHG spectra that faithfully retain those trajectories that contribute to the far-field spectra while filtering out those that do not, already at the microscopic level. Our findings emphasize the similarities between atomic and solid-state HHG by highlighting the importance of the intensity-dependent phase of HHG emission and address the longstanding issue regarding the origin of extremely short dephasing times in solid-state HHG.",

For a very specific value of this twist angle, known as magic angle, twisted bilayer graphene displays a unique phase diagram that cannot be found in other systems. Recently, high-harmonic generation spectroscopy has been successfully applied to elucidate the electronic properties of quantum materials. The purpose of the present work is to exploit the nonlinear optical response of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene to unveil its electronic properties. We show that the band structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is imprinted onto its high-harmonic spectrum. Specifically, we observe a drastic decrease of harmonic signal as we approach the magic angle. Our results show that high-harmonic generation can be used as a spectroscopy tool for measuring the twist angle and also the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene, paving the way for an all-optical characterization of moiré materials.",

However, so far all its realizations have been based on a continuous evolution of the quantum state, following a cyclic path. Here we introduce and demonstrate a conceptually new manifestation of the Berry phase in light-driven crystals, in which the electronic wavefunction accumulates a geometric phase during a discrete evolution between different bands, while preserving the coherence of the process. We experimentally reveal this phase by using a strong laser field to engineer an internal interferometer, induced during less than one cycle of the driving field, which maps the phase onto the emission of higher-order harmonics. Our work provides an opportunity for the study of geometric phases, leading to a variety of observations in light-driven topological phenomena and attosecond solid-state physics.",

In the spatial domain, recent advances in the real-space interpretation of high-harmonic emission in solids allows imaging the field-free, static, potential of the valence electrons with picometer resolution. The combination of such extreme spatial and temporal resolutions to measure and control strong-field dynamics in solids at the atomic scale is poised to unlock a new frontier of lightwave electronics. Here, we report a strong intensity-dependent anisotropy in the high-harmonic generation from ReS\n                    2\n                    that we attribute to angle-dependent interference of currents from the different atoms in the unit cell. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the laser parameters control the relative contribution of these atoms to the high-harmonic emission. Our findings provide an unprecedented atomic perspective on strong-field dynamics in crystals, revealing key factors to consider in the route towards developing efficient harmonic emitters.",

While machine learning and neural networks have been finding applications across many areas of science and technology, their use in decoding ultrafast dynamics of quantum systems driven by strong laser fields has been limited so far. Here we use standard deep neural networks to analyze simulated noisy spectra of highly nonlinear optical response of a 2-dimensional gapped graphene crystal to intense few-cycle laser pulses. We show that a computationally simple 1-dimensional system provides a useful \"nursery school\" for our neural network, allowing it to be retrained to treat more complex 2D systems, recovering the parametrized band structure and spectral phases of the incident few-cycle pulse with high accuracy, in spite of significant amplitude noise and phase jitter. Our results offer a route for attosecond high harmonic spectroscopy of quantum dynamics in solids with a simultaneous, all-optical, solid-state based complete characterization of few-cycle pulses, including their nonlinear spectral phase and the carrier envelope phase.",

It has been shown that shining circularly-polarized light allows to achieve close to 100% of valley polarization, opening the way to valley-based transistors. Yet, switching of the valley polarization is still a key challenge for the practical implementation of such devices due to the short valley lifetimes. Recent progress in ultrashort laser technology now allows to produce trains of attosecond pulses with controlled phase and polarization between the pulses. Taking advantage of such technology, we introduce a coherent control protocol to turn on, off and switch the valley polarization at faster timescales than electron-hole decoherence and valley depolarization, that is, an ultrafast optical valley switch. We theoretically demonstrate the protocol for hBN and MoS2 monolayers calculated from first principles. Additionally, using two time-delayed linearly-polarized pulses with perpendicular polarization, we show that we can extract the electronic dephasing time T2 from the valley Hall conductivity.",

            "summary": "AbstractConventional approaches to probing ultrafast molecular dynamics rely on the use of synchronized laser pulses with a well-defined time delay. Typically, a pump pulse excites a molecular wavepacket. A subsequent probe pulse can then dissociate or ionize the molecule, and measurement of the molecular fragments provides information about where the wavepacket was for each time delay. Here, we propose to exploit the ultrafast nuclear-position-dependent emission obtained due to large light–matter coupling in plasmonic nanocavities to image wavepacket dynamics using only a single pump pulse. We show that the time-resolved emission from the cavity provides information about when the wavepacket passes a given region in nuclear configuration space. This approach can image both cavity-modified dynamics on polaritonic (hybrid light–matter) potentials in the strong light–matter coupling regime and bare-molecule dynamics in the intermediate coupling regime of large Purcell enhancements, and provides a route towards ultrafast molecular spectroscopy with plasmonic nanocavities.",

            "summary": "Strong coupling of quantum emitters with confined electromagnetic modes of nanophotonic structures may be used to change optical, chemical, and transport properties of materials, with significant theoretical effort invested toward a better understanding of this phenomenon. However, a full theoretical description of both matter and light is an extremely challenging task. Typical theoretical approaches simplify the description of the photonic environment by describing it as a single mode or few modes. While this approximation is accurate in some cases, it breaks down strongly in complex environments, such as within plasmonic nanocavities, and the electromagnetic environment must be fully taken into account. This requires the quantum description of a continuum of bosonic modes, a problem that is computationally hard. We here investigate a compromise where the quantum character of light is taken into account at modest computational cost. To do so, we focus on a quantum emitter that interacts with an arbitrary photonic spectral density and employ the cumulant, or cluster, expansion method to the Heisenberg equations of motion up to first, second, and third order. We benchmark the method by comparing it with exact solutions for specific situations and show that it can accurately represent dynamics for many parameter ranges.",

            "summary": "AbstractIsotropic gases irradiated by long pulses of intense IR light can generate very high harmonics of the incident field. It is generally accepted that, due to the symmetry of the generating medium, be it an atomic or an isotropic molecular gas, only odd harmonics of the driving field can be produced. Here we show how the interplay of electronic and nuclear dynamics can lead to a marked breakdown of this standard picture: a substantial part of the harmonic spectrum can consist of even rather than odd harmonics. We demonstrate the effect using ab-initio solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for \"Equation missing\" and its isotopes in full dimensionality. By means of a simple analytical model, we identify its physical origin, which is the appearance of a permanent dipole moment in dissociating homonuclear molecules, caused by light-induced localization of the electric charge during dissociation. The effect arises for sufficiently long laser pulses and the region of the spectrum where even harmonics are produced is controlled by pulse duration. Our results (i) show how the interplay of femtosecond nuclear and attosecond electronic dynamics, which affects the charge flow inside the dissociating molecule, is reflected in the nonlinear response, and (ii) force one to augment standard selection rules found in nonlinear optics textbooks by considering light-induced modifications of the medium during the generation process.",

The feasibility of engineering quantum Hamiltonians with photonic tools, combined with the availability of entangled photons, raises the intriguing possibility of employing topologically protected entangled states in optical quantum computing and information processing. However, while two-photon states built as a product of two topologically protected single-photon states inherit full protection from their single-photon “parents”, a high degree of non-separability may lead to rapid deterioration of the two-photon states after propagation through disorder. In this work, we identify physical mechanisms which contribute to the vulnerability of entangled states in topological photonic lattices. Further, we show that in order to maximize entanglement without sacrificing topological protection, the joint spectral correlation map of two-photon states must fit inside a well-defined topological window of protection.",

Valley-selective excitations, governed by the circularly polarized light resonant with the material’s bandgap, are the foundation of valleytronics. It is often assumed that achieving valley selective excitation in pristine graphene with all-optical means is not possible due to the inversion symmetry of the system. Here, we demonstrate that both valley-selective excitation and valley-selective high-harmonic generation can be achieved in pristine graphene by using a combination of two counter-rotating circularly polarized fields, the fundamental and its second harmonic. Controlling the relative phase between the two colors allows us to select the valleys where the electron–hole pairs and higher-order harmonics are generated. We also describe an all-optical method for measuring valley polarization in graphene with a weak probe pulse. This work offers a robust recipe to write and read valley-selective electron excitations in materials with zero bandgap and zero Berry curvature.",

The process of autoionization, induced by resonant excitation of electrons into discrete states present in the spectral continuum of atomic and molecular targets, is mediated by electron correlation. Here we investigate the attosecond photoemission dynamics in argon in the 20–40 eV spectral range, in the vicinity of the 3s−1np autoionizing resonances. We present measurements of the differential photoionization cross section and extract energy and angle-dependent atomic time delays with an attosecond interferometric method. With the support of a theoretical model, we are able to attribute a large part of the measured time delay anisotropy to the presence of autoionizing resonances, which not only distort the phase of the emitted photoelectron wave packet but also introduce an angular dependence.",

            "summary": "AbstractHigh harmonic generation in multi-color laser fields opens the opportunity of generating isolated attosecond pulses with high ellipticity. Such pulses hold the potential for time-resolving chiral electronic, magnetization, and spin dynamics at their natural timescale. However, this potential cannot be realized without characterizing the exact polarization state of light on the attosecond timescale. Here we propose and numerically demonstrate a complete solution of this problem. Our solution exploits the extrinsic two-dimensional chirality induced in an atom interacting with the chiral attosecond pulse and a linearly polarized infrared probe. The resulting asymmetry in the photoelectron spectra allows to reconstruct the complete polarization state of the attosecond pulse, including its possible time dependence. The challenging problem of distinguishing circularly polarized, partially polarized, or unpolarized pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range is also resolved. We expect this approach to become the core ingredient for attosecond measurements of chiral-sensitive processes in gas and condensed phase.",

            "summary": "AbstractElectron dynamics induced by resonant absorption of light is of fundamental importance in nature and has been the subject of countless studies in many scientific areas. Above the ionization threshold of atomic or molecular systems, the presence of discrete states leads to autoionization, which is an interference between two quantum paths: direct ionization and excitation of the discrete state coupled to the continuum. Traditionally studied with synchrotron radiation, the probability for autoionization exhibits a universal Fano intensity profile as a function of excitation energy. However, without additional phase information, the full temporal dynamics cannot be recovered. Here we use tunable attosecond pulses combined with weak infrared radiation in an interferometric setup to measure not only the intensity but also the phase variation of the photoionization amplitude across an autoionization resonance in argon. The phase variation can be used as a fingerprint of the interactions between the discrete state and the ionization continua, indicating a new route towards monitoring electron correlations in time.",

An attosecond pulse drives the excitations of an electronic wavepacket in water molecules. The process comprises two steps: a transition to core-excited states near the oxygen atoms accompanied by transition to valence-excited states. Thus, the wavepacket is impulsively created at a specific atomic site within a few hundred attoseconds through a nonlinear interaction between the water and the x-ray pulse. We observe this nonlinear signature in an intensity-dependent Stokes Raman sideband at 526 eV. Our measurements are supported by our state-of-the-art calculations based on the polarization response of water dimers in bulk solvation and propagation of attosecond x-ray pulses at liquid density.",

            "summary": "Abstract\n               Synthetic chiral light enables ultrafast and highly efficient imaging of molecular chirality. Unlike standard circularly polarized light, the handedness of synthetic chiral light does not rely on the spatial structure of the light field: it is encoded locally, in the chiral trajectory that the tip of the electric-field vector draws in time, at each point in space. Synthetic chiral light that is both locally and globally chiral (Ayuso et al 2019 Nat. Photon.\n                  13 866) allows us to selectively quench the nonlinear response of a selected molecular enantiomer while maximizing it in its mirror twin at the level of total signal intensities. Synthetic chiral light that exhibits polarization of chirality (Ayuso et al 2021 Nat. Commun.\n                  12 3951) allows us to realize a chiral version of Young’s double-slit experiment that leads to enantio-sensitive light bending. Here we connect these new concepts, and show how one can structure the local and global handedness of synthetic chiral light in space to create optical fields which can be both globally chiral and chirality polarized. Using state-of-the-art computational modeling, we show how these local and global properties are imprinted in the enantio-sensitive response of chiral molecules, creating exciting opportunities for ultrafast, all-optical and highly efficient imaging of molecular chirality.",

In contrast to traditional sum-frequency generation, our approach encodes the medium’s handedness in the intensity of the emitted harmonic signal, rather than in its phase, and it enables full control over the enantiosensitive response. We show how, by sculpting the sub-optical-cycle oscillations of the driving laser field, we can force one molecular enantiomer to emit bright light while its mirror twin remains dark, thus reaching the ultimate efficiency limit of chiral sensitivity via low-order nonlinear light-matter interactions. Our work paves the way for ultrafast and highly efficient imaging and control of the chiral electronic clouds of chiral molecules using lasers with moderate intensities, in all states of matter: from gases to liquids to solids, with molecular specificity and on ultrafast time scales.",

Traditional optical methods using elliptically/circularly polarized light rely on linear effects which arise beyond the electric-dipole approximation, posing major limitations for ultrafast spectroscopy. Here we show how to turn an ultrashort elliptical pulse into an efficient chiro-optical tool: by tilting its polarization plane towards its propagation direction. This forward tilt can be achieved by focusing the beam tightly, creating structured light which exhibits a nontrivial polarization pattern in space. Using state-of-the-art computational modelling, we show that our structured field realizes a near-field interferometer for efficient chiral recognition that separates the nonlinear optical response of left- and right-handed molecules in space. Our work provides a simple, yet highly efficient, way of spatially structuring the polarization of light to image molecular chirality, with extreme enantio-efficiency and on ultrafast time scales.",

Bright HHG beams typically emerge from a longitudinal phased distribution of atomic-scale quantum antennae. Here, we form a transverse necklace-shaped phased array of linearly polarized HHG emitters, where orbital angular momentum conservation allows us to tune the line spacing and divergence properties of extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray high-harmonic combs. The on-axis HHG emission has extremely low divergence, well below that obtained when using Gaussian driving beams, which further decreases with harmonic order. This work provides a new degree of freedom for the design of harmonic combs—particularly in the soft x-ray regime, where very limited options are available. Such harmonic beams can enable more sensitive probes of the fastest correlated charge and spin dynamics in molecules, nanoparticles, and materials.",

This work demonstrates that polarization control and characterization of high-harmonic generation provides an excellent ellipsometry tool that can fully retrieve both the amplitude and phase of a strong-field-driven dipole response. The polarization control of high-harmonic generation is realized by a transient nonlinear dipole grating coherently induced by two noncollinear counterrotating laser fields. By adjusting the ellipticity of the two driving pulses simultaneously, the polarization state of every high-harmonic order can be tuned from linear to highly elliptical, and it is fully characterized through an energy-resolved extreme ultraviolet polarimeter. From the analysis of the polarization state, the ellipsometry indicated that both the amplitude and phase of the high-harmonic dipole scale rapidly with the driving laser field for higher-order harmonics, and, especially, for gases with a small ionization potential. Our experimental results were corroborated by theoretical simulations. Our findings revealed a novel high-harmonic ellipsometry technique that can be used for the next generation of high-harmonic spectroscopy and attosecond metrology studies because of its ability to provide single-digit attosecond accuracy. Our work also paves the way to precisely quantify the strong-field dynamics of fundamental processes associated with the transfer of energy and angular momentum between electron/spin systems and the symmetry-dependent properties of molecules and materials.",

An accurate control of their properties, such as polarization, is fundamental to shape three-dimensional laser-driven dynamics. We introduce a technique to generate attosecond pulse trains whose polarization state varies from pulse to pulse. This is accomplished by driving high-harmonic generation with two time-delayed bichromatic counter-rotating fields with proper orbital angular momentum (OAM) content. Our simulations show that the evolution of the polarization state along the train can be controlled via OAM, pulse duration, and time delay of the driving fields. We, thus, introduce an additional control into structured attosecond pulses that provides an alternative route to explore ultrafast dynamics with potential applications in chiral and magnetic materials.",

            "summary": "We unveil multifaceted effects of spin-charge couplings on the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in Mott insulators by analyzing the two-leg ladder Hubbard model, where spin dynamics activated by the interchain hopping ty drastically modifies the HHG features. When the two chains are decoupled (ty=0), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs because of spin-charge separation. With increasing ty, the doublon-holon pairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant nonlocal spin strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin polarons—charges dressed by spin clouds—leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large ty, we identify unconventional HHG processes involving  elementary excitations—two polarons and one magnon. Our study is an essential step toward a microscopic understanding of nontrivial many-body effects on HHG in correlated materials beyond conventional semiconductors.",

We simulate such imperfections by randomly modifying the chemical potential across the individual lattice sites. We control the degree of electron–electron interaction by varying the Hubbard U. In the limit of vanishing U, this approach results in Anderson localization. For nonvanishing U, we rationalize the spectral observations in terms of qualitative k-space and real-space pictures. When the interaction and imperfection terms are of comparable magnitude, they may balance each other out, causing Bloch-like transitions. If the terms differ significantly, each electron transition requires a relatively large amount of energy and the current is reduced. We find that imperfections result in increased high-harmonic gain. The spectral gain is mainly in high harmonic orders for low U and low orders for high U.",

            "summary": "Abstract\n               We study the expansion of a one-dimensional boson gas by initialising it in a small region of a chain, and then suddenly allowing it to expand into the remainder of the chain. We consider three initial ground-state configurations: the Mott insulator, the conventional superfluid, whose momentum density is sharply peaked at zero momentum, and the cat-like state with momentum peaks at ±π/2, produced by kinetic driving, the latter being a particular case of a flat-band system. In turn, we consider three types of expansion: spectroscopic (with interactions tuned to zero), dynamic (with standard short-range repulsive interactions), and under kinetic driving. The numerical calculations are exact. We compute the momentum and real-space one-particle densities, as well as the two-particle momentum correlations. We find that the spectroscopic time-of-flight experiment reflects the initial momentum distribution except for the larger number of momentum states and at high momenta. For the dynamic expansion starting from an insulator, we recover the non-equilibrium quasi-condensation into momenta ±π/2, provide a physical explanation in terms of interacting bosons that is confirmed by the numerical simulation, and note the existence of nontrivial correlations in the momentum distribution. Under kinetic driving the expansion is comparatively slow, but we conjecture that at high densities it will be much faster. We compare various measures of the two-particle momentum correlations, noting that some of them tend to conceal the possible cat-like structure of a many-body state.",
