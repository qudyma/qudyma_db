            "summary": "We develop the semiconductor Wannier equations (SWEs), a real-time, real-space formulation of ultrafast light-matter dynamics in crystals, by deriving the equations of motion for the electronic reduced density matrix in a localized Wannier basis. Working in real space removes the structure-gauge ambiguities that hinder reciprocal-space semiconductor Bloch equations. Electron--electron interactions are included at the time-dependent Hartree plus static screened-exchange (TD-HSEX) level. Decoherence is modeled with three complementary channels: pure dephasing, population relaxation, and distance-dependent real-space dephasing; providing physically grounded damping for strong-field phenomena such as high-harmonic generation. Conceptually, the SWEs bridge real-space semiclassical intuition with many-body solid-state optics, offering a numerically robust and gauge-clean alternative to reciprocal-space approaches for nonlinear optical response and attosecond spectroscopy in solids.",

            "summary": "A thin-walled tubular superconductor develops a quantized fluxoid in the presence of an axial magnetic field. The fluxoid corresponds to the number of phase windings of the superconducting order parameter and is topological in nature. When the tube has a radius variation along the axial direction, forming a bottleneck structure between sections with different radius, a fluxoid mismatch can appear depending on the applied magnetic field. The bottleneck then becomes a topological boundary and is host to topologically protected solutions for the order parameter, dubbed fluxoid solitons, that are free to move around bottlenecks with cylindrical symmetry. Fluxoid solitons are a new type of vortex with non-quantized flux, loosely related to Pearl vortices in thin superconducting films and fluxons in Corbino Josephson junctions. We characterize their properties as a function of system parameters using the self-consistent quasiclassical theory of diffusive superconductors. We consider both short bottleneck structures and long tapered tubes, where multiple trapped fluxoid solitons adopt elaborate arrangements dictated by their mutual repulsion.",

            "summary": "We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\\pi$ twists or \\textit{fluxoids} that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field or a gate voltage at the junction. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full-shell nanowires are in the topological superconducting regime.",

            "summary": "We propose a novel type of superconducting spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. The two SASQ states are the degenerate spin orientations of an Andreev bound state trapped in a circular Josephson junction with a Corbino disk geometry, created on a 2DEG. The junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The fluxoid mismatch produces a cancellation of the induced pairing that traps unconventional spin-degenerate Andreev bound states analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi soliton states. They are localized at a position around the junction that can be controlled by changing the superconducting phase difference. Moving a soliton state with a phase bias induces a holonomic rotation of its spin, by virtue of the spin-orbit coupling in the 2DEG. The holonomic qubit trajectories can densely cover the full Bloch sphere as the soliton state revolves around the junction. Effects of non-holonomic (dynamic) qubit drift are also analyzed.",

We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current $I_c$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that $I_c$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in $I_c$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in $I_c$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, $\\pi$- and $\\phi$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.",

The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.",

Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave gap is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeema field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.",

One such path is to manipulate quantum properties of solids, such as the valley degree of freedom, with ultrashort controlled lightwaves. Here we employ a sequence of few-optical-cycle visible pulses controlled with attosecond precision to excite and switch the valley pseudospin in a 2D semiconductor. We show that a pair of pulses separated in time with linear orthogonal polarizations can induce a valley-selective population.

Otherwise, their wave function overlap gives rise to a finite energy splitting that shows a characteristic oscillatory pattern $\\sim e^{-2L/\\xi_M}\\cos(k_F L)$ versus external parameters that modify the Fermi momentum $k_F$. Detecting such \"Majorana oscillations\", measurable through low-bias conductance, has been proposed as a strategy for Majorana detection in pristine nanowires. Here we discuss how this detection scheme does not work in full-shell hybrid nanowires, an alternative design to partial-shell nanowires in which a superconductor shell fully wraps the semiconductor core. Using microscopic models, we provide both numerical simulations for Al/InAs hybrids as well as analytical approximations in terms of general nanowire parameters. We find that Majorana oscillations with flux in full-shell nanowires are absent in a wide portion of parameter space. This absence is not a signature of non-overlapping left- and right-end MBSs, but a consequence of the Majorana oscillation period being systematically larger than the flux window of odd Little-Parks lobes where Majorana zero-energy peaks are predicted to appear. Our results demonstrate that split near-zero modes or individual zero-energy crossings should not be dismissed as trivial even if they are found not to oscillate with flux.",

            "summary": "Full-shell nanowires have been proposed as an alternative nanowire design in the search of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). They are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconductor core fully covered by a thin superconductor shell and subject to a magnetic flux. In this work we critically examine this proposal, finding a very rich spectral phenomenology that combines the Little-Parks modulation of the parent-gap superconductor with flux, the presence of flux-dispersing Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analog subgap states, and the emergence of MZMs across finite flux intervals that depend on the transverse wavefunction profile of the charge density in the core section. Through microscopic simulations and analytical derivations, we study different regimes for the semiconductor core, ranging from the hollow-core approximation, to the tubular-core nanowire appropriate for a semiconductor tube with an insulating core, to the solid-core nanowire. We compute the phase diagrams for the different models in cylindrical nanowires and find that MZMs typically coexist with CdGM analogs at zero energy, rendering them gapless. However, we also find topologically protected parameter regions, or islands, with gapped MZMs. In this sense, the most promising candidate to obtain topologically protected MZMs in a full-shell geometry is the nanowire with a tubular-shaped core. Moving beyond pristine nanowires, we study the effect of mode mixing perturbations. Strikingly, mode mixing can act like a topological $p$-wave pairing between particle-hole Bogoliubov partners, and is therefore able to create new topologically protected MZMs in regions of the phase diagram that were originally trivial. As a result, the phase diagram is utterly transformed and exhibits protected MZMs in around half of the parameter space.",

Specifically, we illustrate their formation and stability in intense low-frequency fields, where field strengths surpass the Coulomb field binding the electron-hole pair in the exciton. Additionally, we establish a parallelism between these results and the already-known physics of Rydberg states using an atomic model.

            "summary": "Full-shell nanowires are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconducting core encapsulated in an epitaxial superconducting shell. When subject to an external magnetic flux, they exhibit the Little-Parks (LP) phenomenon of flux-modulated superconductivity, an effect connected to the physics of Abrikosov vortex lines in type-II superconductors. We show theoretically that full-shell nanowires can host subgap states that are a variant of the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in vortices. These CdGM analogs are shell-induced Van Hove singularities in core subbands. We elucidate their structure, parameter dependence and behavior in tunneling spectroscopy through a series of models of growing complexity. Using microscopic numerical simulations, we show that CdGM analogs exhibit a characteristic skewness towards higher flux values inside non-zero LP lobes resulting from the interplay of three ingredients. First, the orbital coupling to the field shifts the energy of the CdGM analogs proportionally to the flux and to their generalized angular momentum. Second, CdGM analogs coalesce into degeneracy points at flux values for which their corresponding radial wavefunctions are threaded by an integer multiple of the flux quantum. And third, the average radii of all CdGM-analog wavefunctions inside the core are approximately equal and are controlled by the electrostatic band bending at the core/shell interface. As the average radius moves away from the interface, the degeneracy points shift towards larger fluxes from the center of the LP lobes, causing the skewness. This analysis provides a transparent interpretation of the nanowire spectrum that allows to extract microscopic information by measuring the number and skewness of CdGM analogs. Moreover, it allows to derive an efficient Hamiltonian of the full-shell nanowire in terms of a modified hollow-core model at the average radius.",

The electrical tunability of this phase makes it an ideal platform to investigate unique topological effects at zero magnetic field, such as topological superconductivity. Here we couple the helical edges of such a heterostructure to a superconductor. The inversion of the bulk gap accompanied by helical states near zero displacement field leads to the suppression of the critical current in a Josephson geometry. Using superconducting quantum interferometry we observe an even-odd effect in the Fraunhofer interference pattern within the inverted gap phase. We show theoretically that this effect is a direct consequence of the emergence of helical modes that connect the two edges of the sample. The absence of such an effect at high displacement field, as well as in bare bilayer graphene junctions, confirms this interpretation and demonstrates the topological nature of the inverted gap. Our results demonstrate the coupling of superconductivity to zero-field topological states in graphene.",

In this work we study a 2D approach based on graphene bilayers encapsulated in transition metal dichalcogenides that, unlike previous proposals involving the Quantum Hall regime in graphene, requires weaker magnetic fields and does not rely on interactions. The encapsulation induces strong spin-orbit coupling on the graphene bilayer, which opens a sizeable gap and stabilizes fragile pairs of helical edge states. We show that, when subject to an in-plane Zeeman field, armchair edges can be transformed into p-wave one-dimensional topological superconductors by contacting them laterally with conventional superconductors. We demonstrate the emergence of Majorana bound states (MBSs) at the sample corners of crystallographically perfect flakes, belonging either to the D or the BDI symmetry classes depending on parameters. We compute the phase diagram, the resilience of MBSs against imperfections, and their manifestation as a 4$\\pi$-periodic effect in Josephson junction geometries, all suggesting the existence of a topological phase within experimental reach.",

This method reduces ambiguities of Majorana detections by checking the consistency between CB spectroscopy and zero bias peaks (ZBPs) in non-blockaded transport.Specifically, we observe junction-dependent, even-odd modulated, single-electron CB peaks in InAs/Al hybrid nanowires (NWs) without concomitant low-bias peaks in tunneling spectroscopy. We provide a theoretical interpretation of the experimental observations in terms of low-energy, longitudinally-confined island states rather than overlapping Majorana modes.

We find that under axially symmetric QD-S coupling, shell fluxoids cause the induced pairing to vanish, producing instead a level renormalization that pushes subgap levels closer to zero energy and flattens fermionic parity crossings as the coupling strength increases. This fluxoid-induced stabilization mechanism has analoges in symmetric S-QD-S Josephson junctions at phase $\\pi$, and can naturally lead to patterns of near-zero modes weakly dispersing with parameters in all but the zero-th lobe of the LP spectrum.",

            "summary": "A semiconducting nanowire fully wrapped by a superconducting shell has been proposed as a platform for obtaining Majorana modes at small magnetic fields. In this study, we demonstrate that the appearance of subgap states in such structures is actually governed by the junction region in tunneling spectroscopy measurements, and not the full-shell nanowire itself. Short tunneling regions never show subgap states, whereas longer junctions always do. This can be understood in terms of quantum dots forming in the junction and hosting Andreev levels in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime. The intricate magnetic field dependence of the Andreev levels, through both the Zeeman and Little-Parks effects, may result in robust zero-bias peaks, features that could be easily misinterpreted as originating from Majorana zero modes, but are unrelated to topological superconductivity.",

Computing the Green function is the backbone of quantum transport, electronic structure or linear response computations. Our method constitutes a \"deflation optimization\" of a well established algorithm often used in quantum transport that is based on generalized Schur factorizations of the linearized quadratic eigenvalue equation for the transfer matrix. Our deflation optimization may greatly reduce the number of degrees of freedom that must be processed in the Schur factorization. Deflation must be supplemented by a Jordan-block reconstruction of generalized eigenvectors, also developed here in detail. The overhead of deflation plus reconstruction is minimal as compared to the typical reduction in factorization runtime. Furthermore, by avoiding inverses of ill-conditioned matrices, the algorithm remains numerically stable.",

Our method extends the standard model Hamiltonian for a superconducting charge qubit and replaces the Josephson potential by the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian of the nanowire junction, projected onto the relevant low-energy subgap subspace. This allows to fully incorporate the coherent dynamics of subgap levels in the junction. The combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman energy in the nanowires forming the junction triggers a topological transition, where the subgap levels evolve from finite-energy Andreev bound states into near-zero energy Majorana bound states. The interplay between the microscopic energy scales governing the nanowire junction (the Josephson energy, the Majorana coupling and the Majorana energy splitting), with the charging energy of the superconducting island, gives rise to a great variety of physical regimes. Based on this interplay of different energy scales, we fully characterize the microwave response of the junction, from the Cooper pair box to the transmon regimes, and show how the presence of Majoranas can be detected through distinct spectroscopic features. In split-junction geometries, the plasma mode couples to the phase-dispersing subgap levels resulting from Majorana hybridization via a Jaynes--Cummings-like interaction. As a consequence of this interaction, higher order plasma excitations in the junction inherit Majorana properties, including the $4\\pi$ effect.",

This occurs as an external magnetic field tunes the wire into the topological regime and the energy splitting of the emergent Majorana modes oscillates around zero energy owing to their wave function spatial overlap in finite-length wires. In particular, we discuss how these Majorana oscillations, and the concomitant fermion parity switches in the ground state of the junction, result in distinct spectroscopic features --in the form of an intermitent visibility of absorption lines-- that strongly deviate from standard transmon behavior. In contrast, non-oscillating zero modes, such as topologically trivial Andreev bound states resulting from sufficiently smooth potentials, exhibit an overall standard transmon response. These differences in the MW response could help determine whether the junction contains topological Majoranas or not.",

In contrast, inhomogeneous superconductors such as those with magnetic impurities or weak links, or heterojunctions containing normal metals or quantum dots, can host subgap electronic excitations that are generically known as Andreev bound states (ABSs). With the advent of topological superconductivity, a new kind of ABS with exotic qualities, known as Majorana bound state (MBS), has been discovered. We review the main properties of ABSs and MBSs, and the state-of-the-art techniques for their detection. We focus on hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, possibly coupled to quantum dots, as one of the most flexible and promising experimental platforms. We discuss how the combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field in these wires triggers the transition from ABSs into MBSs. We show theoretical progress beyond minimal models in understanding experiments, including the possibility of different types of robust zero modes that may emerge without a band-topological transition. We examine the role of spatial non-locality, a special property of MBS wavefunctions that, together with non-Abelian braiding, is the key to realizing topological quantum computation.",

Quasi-flat bands are responsible for a wealth of exotic, correlated-electron phases in the system. In this work we propose a mechanical analogue of twisted bilayer graphene made of two vibrating plates, patterned with a honeycomb mesh of masses, and coupled across a continuum elastic medium. We show that flexural waves in the device exhibit vanishing group velocity and quasi-flat bands at magic angles, in close correspondence with electrons in graphene models. The strong similarities of spectral structure and spatial eigenmodes in the two systems demonstrate the chiral nature of the mechanical flat bands. We derive analytical expressions that quantitatively connect the mechanical and electronic models, which allow us to predict the parameters required for an experimental realization of our proposal.",

            "summary": "Spatial separation of Majorana zero modes distinguishes trivial from topological midgap states and is key to topological protection in quantum computing applications. Although signatures of Majorana zero modes in tunneling spectroscopy have been reported in numerous studies, a quantitative measure of the degree of separation, or nonlocality, of the emergent zero modes has not been reported. Here, we present results of an experimental study of nonlocality of emergent zero modes in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowire devices. The approach takes advantage of recent theory showing that nonlocality can be measured from splitting due to hybridization of the zero mode in resonance with a quantum dot state at one end of the nanowire. From these splittings as well as anticrossing of the dot states, measured for even and odd occupied quantum dot states, we extract both the degree of nonlocality of the emergent zero mode, as well as the spin canting angles of the nonlocal zero mode. Depending on the device measured, we obtain either a moderate degree of nonlocality, suggesting a partially separated Andreev subgap state, or a highly nonlocal state consistent with a well-developed Majorana mode.",

The associated boundary modes between regions of distinct topology have been used to demonstrate robust waveguiding, protected from defects by the topology of the surrounding bulk. A related type of topologically protected state that is not propagating but is bound to a defect has not been demonstrated to date in a bosonic setting. Here we demonstrate numerically and experimentally that an acoustic mode can be topologically bound to a vortex fabricated in a two-dimensional, Kekul\\'e-distorted triangular acoustic lattice. Such lattice realises an acoustic analogue of the Jackiw-Rossi mechanism that topologically binds a bound state in a p-wave superconductor vortex. The acoustic bound state is thus a bosonic \\edit{\\emph{analogue}} of Majorana bound state, \\edit{where the two valleys replace particle and hole components}. We numerically show that it is topologically protected against arbitrary symmetry-preserving local perturbations, and remains pinned to the Dirac frequency of the unperturbed lattice regardless of parameter variations. We demonstrate our prediction experimentally by 3D printing the vortex pattern in a plastic matrix and measuring the spectrum of the acoustic response of the device. Despite viscothermal losses, the measured topological resonance remains robust, with its frequency closely matching our simulations.",

            "summary": "The discovery of topologically non-trivial electronic systems has opened a new age in condensed matter research. From topological insulators to topological superconductors and Weyl semimetals, it is now understood that some of the most remarkable and robust phases in electronic systems (e.g., Quantum Hall or Anomalous Quantum Hall) are the result of topological protection. These powerful ideas have recently begun to be explored also in bosonic systems. Topologically protected acoustic, mechanical, and optical edge states have been demonstrated in a number of systems that recreate the requisite topological conditions. Such states that propagate without backscattering could find important applications in communications and energy technologies. In this work we demonstrate the mechanical analogue of a topologically bound state, a different class of non-propagating protected state that cannot be destroyed by local perturbations. These are well known in electronic systems, such as Majorana bound states in topological superconductors, but remain largely unexplored in a bosonic setting. We implement topological binding by creating a Kekul\\'e distortion vortex on a two-dimensional mechanical honeycomb superlattice.",

We also show that effectively, breaking the mirror symmetry leads to the same topological invariant. Based on the bulk-edge correspondence principle, protected edge states appear at interfaces between two lattices of different valley Chern numbers. By means a plane wave expansion method and the multiple scattering theory for periodic and finite systems respectively, we computed the Berry curvature, the band inversion, mode shapes and edge modes in plate systems.

            "summary": "A key property of Majorana zero modes is their protection against local perturbations. In the standard picture, this protection is guaranteed by a high degree of spatial nonlocality of the Majoranas, namely a suppressed wave-function overlap, in the topological phase. However, a careful characterisation of resilience to local noise goes beyond mere spatial separation, and must also take into account the projection of wave-function spin. By considering the susceptibility of a given zero mode to different local perturbations, we find the relevant forms of spin-resolved wave-function overlaps that measure its resilience. We quantify these overlaps and study their dependence with nanowire parameters in several classes of experimentally relevant configurations. These include nanowires with inhomogeneous depletion and induced pairing, barriers and quantum dots. Smooth inhomogeneities have been shown to produce near-zero modes, so-called pseudo-Majoranas, below the critical Zeeman field in the bulk. Surprisingly, their resilience is found to be comparable or better than that of topological Majoranas in realistic systems. We further study how accurately their overlaps can be estimated using a purely local measurement on one end of the nanowire, accessible through conventional transport experiments. In uniform nanowires this local estimator is remarkably accurate. In inhomogeneous cases it is less accurate but can still provide reasonable estimates for potential inhomogeneities of the order of the superconducting gap. We further analyse the zero mode wave-function structure, spin texture and spectral features associated with each type of inhomogeneity. All our results highlight the strong connection between internal wave-function degrees of freedom, nonlocality and protection in smoothly inhomogeneous nanowires.",

This surprising fact has been used to challenge the interpretation of a number of transport experiments in terms of non-trivial topology with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We show that this ongoing ABS versus MZM controversy is fully clarified when framed in the language of non-Hermitian topology, the natural description for open quantum systems. This change of paradigm allows us to understand topological transitions and the emergence of pairs of zero modes more broadly, in terms of exceptional point (EP) bifurcations of system eigenvalue pairs in the complex plane. Within this framework, we show that some zero energy ABSs are actually non-trivial, and share all the properties of conventional MZMs, such as the recently observed $2e^2/h$ conductance quantization. From this point of view, any distinction between such ABS zero modes and conventional MZMs becomes artificial. The key feature that underlies their common non-trivial properties is an asymmetric coupling of Majorana components to the reservoir, which triggers the EP bifurcation.",

Two kinds of superconducting source and drain contacts are used: epitaxial Al/InSb devices exhibit a doubling of tunneling resonances, while in NbTiN/InSb devices Andreev spectra of the dot appear to be replicated multiple times at increasing source-drain bias voltages. In both devices, a mirage of a crowded spectrum is created. To describe the observations a model is developed that combines the effects of a soft induced gap and of additional Andreev bound states both in the quantum dot and in the finite regions of the nanowire adjacent to the quantum dot. Understanding of Andreev spectroscopy is important for the correct interpretation of Majorana experiments done on the same structures.",

In particular, we focus on critical currents in the short junction limit ($L_{\\rm N}\\ll \\xi$, where $L_{\\rm N}$ is the junction length and $\\xi$ is the superconducting coherence length) and show that they contain important information about nontrivial topology and Majoranas. This includes signatures of the gap inversion at the topological transition and a unique oscillatory pattern that originates from Majorana interference. Interestingly, this pattern can be modified by tuning the transmission across the junction, thus providing complementary evidence of Majoranas and their energy splittings beyond standard tunnel spectroscopy experiments, while offering further tunability by virtue of the Josephson effect.",

Here we show that a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire may be used as a powerful spectroscopic tool to quantify the degree of Majorana non-locality through a local transport measurement. Moreover, the spin polarization of dot sub-gap states at singlet-doublet transitions in the Coulomb blockade regime allows the dot to directly probe the spin structure of the Majorana wave function, and indirectly measure the spin-orbit coupling of the nanowire.",

            "summary": "Majorana zero modes at the boundaries of topological superconductors are charge-neutral, an equal superposition of electrons and holes. This ideal situation is, however, hard to achieve in physical implementations, such as proximitised semiconducting nanowires of realistic length. In such systems Majorana overlaps are unavoidable and lead to their hybridisation into charged Bogoliubov quasiparticles of finite energy which, unlike true zero modes, are affected by electronic interactions. We here demonstrate that these interactions, particularly with bound charges in the dielectric surroundings, drastically change the non-interacting paradigm. Remarkably, interactions may completely suppress Majorana hybridisation around parity crossings, where the total charge in the nanowire changes. This effect, dubbed zero-energy pinning, stabilises Majoranas back to zero energy and charge, and leads to electronically incompressible parameter regions wherein Majoranas remain insensitive to local perturbations, despite their overlap.",

            "summary": "Twisted graphene bilayers develop highly localised states around AA-stacked regions for small twist angles. We show that interaction effects may induce either an antiferromagnetic (AF) and a ferromagnetic (F) polarization of said regions, depending on the electrical bias between layers. Remarkably, F-polarised AA regions under bias develop spiral magnetic ordering, with a relative $120^\\circ$ misalignment between neighbouring regions due to a frustrated antiferromagnetic exchange. This remarkable spiral magnetism emerges naturally without the need of spin-orbit coupling, and competes with the more conventional lattice-antiferromagnetic instability, which interestingly develops at smaller bias under weaker interactions than in monolayer graphene, due to Fermi velocity suppression. This rich and electrically controllable magnetism could turn twisted bilayer graphene into an ideal system to study frustrated magnetism in two dimensions, with interesting potential also for a range of applications.",

The interaction strength between neighboring layers, most easily controlled through their interlayer separation, can have significant influence on the electronic properties of these composite materials. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control over interlayer interactions by locally modifying the interlayer separation between graphene and boron nitride, which we achieve by applying pressure with a scanning tunneling microscopy tip. For the special case of aligned or nearly-aligned graphene on boron nitride, the graphene lattice can stretch and compress locally to compensate for the slight lattice mismatch between the two materials. We find that modifying the interlayer separation directly tunes the lattice strain and induces commensurate stacking underneath the tip. Our results motivate future studies tailoring the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures by controlling the interlayer separation of the entire device using hydrostatic pressure.",

The possibility to consider the electronic states from a tight-binding model is highly useful for the calculation of many physical properties, for which first principle calculations are more demanding in computational terms when having a large number of atoms. Here, we present a set of Slater-Koster parameters for a tight-binding model that accurately reproduce the structure and the orbital character of the valence and conduction bands of single layer MX$_2$, where M = Mo,Wand X = S, Se.

We compare the results to the case of molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) monolayers. We find that the so-called funnel effect, i.e. the possibility of controlling exciton motion by means of inhomogeneous strains, is much stronger in few-layer BP than in MoS$_2$ monolayers and, crucially, is of opposite sign. Instead of excitons accumulating isotropically around regions of high tensile strain like in MoS$_2$, excitons in BP are pushed away from said regions. This \\emph{inverse} funnel effect is moreover highly anisotropic, with much larger funnel distances along the armchair crystallographic direction, leading to a directional focusing of exciton flow. A strong inverse funnel effect could enable simpler designs of funnel solar cells, and offer new possibilities for the manipulation and harvesting of light.",

We analyse how magnetic flux, electric field, interlayer rotation angle, and interactions (treated at a mean field level) combine to produce a pseudo-QSH with broken time-reversal symmetry, and spin-polarized helical edge states. The effect is a consequence of a robust interaction-induced ferrimagnetic ordering of the Quantum Hall ground state under an interlayer bias, provided the two rotated layers are effectively decoupled at low energies. We discuss in detail the electronic structure, and the constraints on system parameters, such as the angle, interactions and magnetic flux, required to reach the pseudo-QSH phase. We find, in particular, that purely local electronic interactions are not sufficient to account for the experimental observations, which demand at least nearest-neighbour interactions to be included.",

Two-dimensional crystals are particularly suited for this purpose because they can withstand unprecedented non-homogeneous deformations before rupture: one can literally bend them and fold them up almost like a piece of paper. Here, we study multi-layer black phosphorus sheets subjected to periodic stress to modulate their optoelectronic properties. We find a remarkable shift of the optical absorption band-edge of up to ~0.7 eV between the regions under tensile and compressive stress, greatly exceeding the strain tunability reported for transition metal dichalcogenides. This observation is supported by theoretical models which also predict that this periodic stress modulation can yield to quantum confinement of carriers at low temperatures. The possibility of generating large strain-induced variations in the local density of charge carriers opens the door for a variety of applications including photovoltaics, quantum optics and two-dimensional optoelectronic devices.",

Recent theoretical and experimental work shows the influence of strains in many properties of graphene not considered before, such as electronic transport, spin-orbit coupling, the formation of Moir\\'e patterns, optics, ... There is also significant evidence of anharmonic effects, which can modify the structural properties of graphene. These phenomena are not restricted to graphene, and they are being intensively studied in other two dimensional materials, such as the metallic dichalcogenides. We review here recent developments related to the role of strains in the structural and electronic properties of graphene and other two dimensional compounds.",

            "summary": "Recent experimental efforts towards the detection of Majorana bound states have focused on creating the conditions for topological superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an alternative route, which achieves fully localised zero-energy Majorana bound states when a topologically trivial superconductor is strongly coupled to a helical normal region. Such a junction can be experimentally realised by e.g. proximitizing a finite section of a nanowire with spin-orbit coupling, and combining electrostatic depletion and a Zeeman field to drive the non-proximitized (normal) portion into a helical phase. Majorana zero modes emerge in such an open system without fine-tuning as a result of charge-conjugation symmetry, and can be ultimately linked to the existence of `exceptional points' (EPs) in parameter space, where two quasibound Andreev levels bifurcate into two quasibound Majorana zero modes. After the EP, one of the latter becomes non-decaying as the junction approaches perfect Andreev reflection, thus resulting in a Majorana dark state (MDS) localised at the NS junction. We show that MDSs exhibit the full range of properties associated to conventional closed-system Majorana bound states (zero-energy, self-conjugation, $4\\pi$-Josephson effect and non-Abelian braiding statistics), while not requiring topological superconductivity.",

            "summary": "The Josephson effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon consisting in the appearance of a dissipationless supercurrent in a weak link between two superconducting (S) electrodes. While the mechanism leading to the Josephson effect is quite general, i.e., Andreev reflections at the interface between the S electrodes and the weak link, the precise physical details and topology of the junction drastically modify the properties of the supercurrent. Specifically, a strong enhancement of the critical supercurrent $I_C$ is expected to occur when the topology of the junction allows the emergence of Majorana bound states. Here we report charge transport measurements in mesoscopic Josephson junctions formed by InAs nanowires and Ti/Al superconducting leads. Our main observation is a colossal enhancement of the critical supercurrent induced by an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the substrate. This striking and anomalous supercurrent enhancement cannot be ascribed to any known conventional phenomenon existing in Josephson junctions including, for instance, Fraunhofer-like diffraction or a $\\pi$-state behavior. We also investigate an unconventional model related to inhomogenous Zeeman field caused by magnetic focusing, and note that it can not account for the observed behaviour. Finally, we consider these results in the context of topological superconductivity, and show that the observed $I_C$ enhancement is compatible with a magnetic field-induced topological transition of the junction.",

            "summary": "A clear demonstration of topological superconductivity (TS) and Majorana zero modes remains one of the major pending goal in the field of topological materials. One common strategy to generate TS is through the coupling of an s-wave superconductor to a helical half-metallic system. Numerous proposals for the latter have been put forward in the literature, most of them based on semiconductors or topological insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach for the creation of TS in graphene/superconductor junctions without the need of spin-orbit coupling. Our prediction stems from the helicity of graphene's zero Landau level edge states in the presence of interactions, and on the possibility, experimentally demonstrated, to tune their magnetic properties with in-plane magnetic fields. We show how canted antiferromagnetic ordering in the graphene bulk close to neutrality induces TS along the junction, and gives rise to isolated, topologically protected Majorana bound states at either end. We also discuss possible strategies to detect their presence in graphene Josephson junctions through Fraunhofer pattern anomalies and Andreev spectroscopy. The latter in particular exhibits strong unambiguous signatures of the presence of the Majorana states in the form of universal zero bias anomalies. Remarkable progress has recently been reported in the fabrication of the proposed type of junctions, which offers a promising outlook for Majorana physics in graphene systems.",

Here we derive a simple low energy model for graphene carriers close to alignment with the substrate, taking into account spontaneous strains at equilibrium, pseudogauge fields and deformation potentials. We carry out a detailed characterisation of the modified band structure, gap, local and global density of states, and band topology in terms of physical parameters.

When the lattice axes of graphene and the substrate are aligned, strains reach a value of order 2\\%, leading to effective magnetic fields above 100T.

This behaviour has been interpreted as the result of an intrinsic electronic instability induced by many-body correlations. Intriguingly, however, some samples of similar mobility exhibit good metallic properties, with a minimal conductivity of the order of $2e^2/h$. Here we propose an explanation for this dichotomy, which is unrelated to electron interactions and based instead on the reversible formation of boundaries between stacking domains (`solitons'). We argue, using a numerical analysis, that the hallmark features of the previously inferred many-body insulating state can be explained by scattering on boundaries between domains with different stacking order (AB and BA). We furthermore present experimental evidence, reinforcing our interpretation, of reversible switching between a metallic and an insulating regime in suspended bilayers when subjected to thermal cycling or high current annealing.",

Changing from one crystal structure to another involves a phase transition which is usually controlled by a state variable such as temperature or pressure. In the case of trilayer graphene, there are two common stacking configurations (Bernal and rhombohedral) which exhibit very different electronic properties. In graphene flakes with both stacking configurations, the region between them consists of a localized strain soliton where the carbon atoms of one graphene layer shift by the carbon-carbon bond distance. Here we show the ability to move this strain soliton with a perpendicular electric field and hence control the stacking configuration of trilayer graphene with only an external voltage. Moreover, we find that the free energy difference between the two stacking configurations scales quadratically with electric field, and thus rhombohedral stacking is favored as the electric field increases. This ability to control the stacking order in graphene opens the way to novel devices which combine structural and electrical properties.",

            "summary": "A twisted graphene bilayer exhibits a triangular Moir\\'e pattern in the local stacking, that smoothly alternates between the three basic types AA', AB' and BA'. Under an interlayer bias U, the latter two types develop a spectral gap, characterised by opposite valley Chern numbers. We show that for large enough Moir\\'e periods and bias, these regions become depleted electronically, and topologically protected helical modes appear at their boundaries. This gives rise to a delocalised topological network of the Chalker-Coddington type, composed of valley current vortices. This network can be tailored by controlled deposition of valley-mixing adsorbates, which block transmission in selected links, thus opening the possibility of custom topological nanoelectronics.",

Despite the absence of a fractional steady-state ac Josephson current in the topological phase, the dissipative multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) current I_dc at different junction transparencies is particularly revealing. It exhibits unique features related to topology, such as the gap inversion, the formation of Majorana bound states, and fermion-parity conservation.

Such defects are often encountered at steps in the substrate of graphene grown on silicon carbide. We show that AB or AA stacked bilayer stripes result in large Hall conductivity fluctuations that destroy the quantum Hall plateaux. The fluctuations are a result of the coupling of edge states at opposite edges through currents traversing the stripe. Upon rotation of the second layer with respect to the continuous monolayer (a twisted-bilayer stripe defect), such currents decouple from the extended edge states and develop into long-lived discrete quasi bound states circulating around the perimeter of the stripe. Backscattering of edge modes then occurs only at precise resonant energies, and hence the quantum Hall plateaux are recovered as twist angle grows.",

As the Zeeman field crosses the critical bulk value B_c of the topological transition, a Majorana bound state (MBS) is formed, giving rise to a sharp zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in the tunneling differential conductance. We identify novel features beyond this picture in wires with inhomogeneous depletion, like the appearance of two MBSs inside a long depleted region for B<B_c. The resulting ZBA is in most cases weakly split and may coexist with Andreev bound states near zero energy. The ZBA may appear without evidence of a topological gap closing. This latter aspect is more evident in the multiband case and stems from a smooth pinch-off barrier. Most of these features are in qualitative agreement with recent experiments [Mourik et al, Science 336, 1003 (2012)]. We also discuss the rich phenomenology of the problem in other regimes which remain experimentally unexplored.",

Finding an experimental setup with these unconventional properties poses, however, a serious challenge: for finite-length wires, the equilibrium supercurrents are always 2\\pi-periodic as anticrossings of states with the same fermionic parity are possible. We show, however, that the anomaly survives in the transient regime of the ac Josephson effect. Transients are moreover protected against decay by quasiparticle poisoning as a consequence of the quantum Zeno effect, which fixes the parity of Majorana qubits. The resulting long-lived ac Josephson transients may be effectively used to detect MBS.",

Combining the self-consistent computation of the phonon self-energy with renormalization group methods, we show that graphene has two different phases corresponding to soft and strong renormalization of the bending rigidity in the long-wavelength limit. In the first case, the system may have an intermediate scale in which the phonon dispersion is softened, but it manages finally to become increasingly rigid over large distance scales. The strongly renormalized phase is closer however to critical behavior, with an effective rigidity that becomes pinned in practice at very small values, implying a very large susceptibility for the development of a condensate of the flexural phonon field.",

The evanescent modes dominate pumping at the Dirac point, and give rise to a universal response under weak driving for short and wide pumps, in close analogy to their role for the minimal conductivity in ballistic transport.

We show that the interplay between the induced average doping (arising from the non-zero average of the disorder) and impurity scattering modifies the traditional picture of phase-coherent transport. Close to the Dirac point, intrinsic evanescent modes produced by the impurities dominate transport at short lengths, giving rise to a new regime analogous to pseudodiffusive transport in clean graphene, but without the requirement of heavily doped contacts. This intrinsic pseudodiffusive regime precedes the traditional ballistic, diffusive and localized regimes. The last two regimes exhibit a strongly modified effective number of propagating modes, and a mean free path which becomes anomalously large close to the Dirac point.",

On the other hand, fluctuating fields induce random geometric phases that lead to spin relaxation and dephasing, thus limiting the use of such spins as qubits.

All current cumulants are shown to scale with system parameters (doping, size, disorder strength and correlation length) in an identical fashion for large enough systems. In the case of 2D disorder, numerical evidence is given for the same kind of identical scaling of all current cumulants, so that the ratio of any two such cumulants is universal. Specific universal values are given for the Fano factor, which is smaller than the pseudodiffusive value of ballistic graphene (F=1/3) both for 1D (F=0.243) and 2D (F=0.295) disorder.

Even in vanishing magnetic field, B = 0, slow noise coupling to the electron's orbital degree of freedom leads to dephasing of the spin due to a random, in general non-Abelian Berry phase acquired by the spin. For illustration we first present a simple quasiclassical description, then consider a model with 2 orbital states only, and finally present a perturbative quantum treatment appropriate for an electron in a realistic (roughly parabolic, not too strongly confining) quantum dot. We further compare the effect of different sources of noise.

The finite-backscattering beam splitter geometry is supplemented by a phenomenological model for inelastic scattering, the charge-conserving voltage probe model, conveniently generalized to deal with entangled states. We find that the behavior of shot-noise measurements in one of the outgoing leads remains an efficient way to characterize the nature of the non-local spin correlations in the incoming currents for an inelastic scattering probability up to 50%. Higher order cumulants are analyzed, and are found to contain no additional useful information on the spin correlations. The technique we have developed is applicable to a wide range of systems with voltage probes and spin correlations.",

            "summary": "Electron backscattering in a Luttinger liquid with an impurity is investigated in the presence of zero point motion of the phonon lattice. The impurity can mean either a mass defect, an elastic defect or a pinning defect. The phonon spectrum is then affected by the presence of the defect, which enters in the renormalization group equations for backscattering. The RG equation becomes dependent on the energy cutoff for finite Debye frequency $\\omega_D$ giving rise to finite energy effects. We compute the local density of states and show how the renormalization group flow is affected by a finite $\\omega_D$.",

We extend the standard description of the grain in terms of a single collective variable, the charge and its conjugated phase, to include the spin degree of freedom. The suppression of spin fluctuations enhances the tendency towards Coulomb blockade. The effective charging energy and conductance are calculated numerically in the regime of large grain-lead coupling.",

            "summary": "We study theoretically the local density of states (DOS) in a topological Josephson junction. We show that the well-known 4π Josephson effect originates from the interference effect between two Majorana fermions (MFs) that are localized at the Josephson junction. In addition, the DOS for electrons (holes) shows the 4π interference information along each parity conserved energy spectrum. The DOS displays a 2π period oscillation when two trivial states interfere with each other. This means that the DOS information may be used to distinguish the MFs from trivial localized states. We suggest that the interference effect and the DOS can be detected by using two STM leads or two normal leads. A single side lead can only detect the Andreev reflection tunneling process in the junction, which cannot reveal information about the interference effect in general. However, using two side leads, we can reveal information about the interference effect of the MFs as well as the DOS by combining Andreev reflection with the electron transmission process.",

We investigate this effect in a Rashba nanowire coupled to a ferromagnetic lead and demonstrate that it can be detected via non-local transport spectroscopy: while local conductance remains symmetric, the non-local conductance becomes non-reciprocal. We account for this behavior using both conventional transport arguments and the framework of non-Hermitian physics. Furthermore, we explain that exceptional points shift in parameter space when transitioning from periodic to open boundary conditions, a phenomenon observed in other non-Hermitian systems but so far not explained. Our results establish transport spectroscopy as a tool to probe non-Hermitian effects in open electronic systems.",

Simple yet accurate approximations that capture strain effects in demanding simulations of mesoscopic nanostructures are therefore highly desirable. However, for III-V compounds, key materials for quantum applications, such approaches remain comparatively underdeveloped. In this work, we derive a compact, effective Hamiltonian that describes the conduction band of zincblende III-V semiconductors incorporating strain effects. Starting from the eight-band k$\\cdot$p model with Bir-Pikus corrections, we perform a folding-down procedure to obtain analytical expressions for conduction-band strain-renormalized parameters, including the effective mass, chemical potential, spin-orbit coupling, and $g$-factor. The model reproduces full multiband results under small to moderate strain, while retaining a form suitable for device-scale calculations. We benchmark the model for bulk deformations and apply it to representative nanostructures, such as core.shell nanowires and planar heterostructures. Our results provide a practical and versatile tool for incorporating strain into the design of III-V semiconductor devices, enabling reliable predictions of their properties with direct implications for spintronic, straintronic, optoelectronic, and topological quantum technologies.",

The Josephson effect in such ultrasmall junctions has been used to unveil new switching dynamics, study coupling close to superconducting bound states or reveal non-reciprocal effects. However, the Josephson coupling is weak and the sensitivity to temperature reduces the Cooper pair current magnitude. Here we show that a feedback element induces a time-dependent bistable regime which consists of spontaneous periodic oscillations between two different Cooper pair tunneling states (corresponding to the DC and AC Josephson regimes respectively). The amplitude of the time-averaged current within the bistable regime is almost independent of temperature. By tracing the periodic oscillations in the new bistable regime as a function of the position in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope, we obtain atomic scale maps of the critical current in 2H-NbSe$_2$ and find spatial modulations due to a pair density wave. Our results fundamentally improve our understanding of atomic size Josephson junctions including a feedback element in the circuit and provide a promising new route to study superconducting materials through atomic scale maps of the Josephson coupling.",

            "summary": "Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps. In addition, the SM wavefunction spreads all across the section of the nanowire, leading typically to a finite background of trivial subgap states with which MZMs may coexist. To overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs as the SM part of a full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that emerges from the combination of the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction of the SM active shell and the confinement effects of the nanostructure, thus depending mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on red electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry. As a result, core-shell SM hole-band NWs are found to be a promising candidate to explore Majorana physics in full-hell hybrid devices, addressing several challenges in the field.",

Here, we analyze a tripartite SM/FI/SC heterostructure but realized in a planar stacking geometry, where the thin FI layer acts as a spin-polarized tunneling barrier between the SM and the SC. We optimize the system's geometrical parameters using microscopic simulations, finding the range of FI thicknesses for which the hybrid system can be tuned into the topological regime. Within this range, and thanks to the vertical confinement provided by the stacking geometry, trivial and topological phases alternate regularly as the external gate is varied, displaying a hard topological gap that can reach half of the SC one. This is a significant improvement compared to setups using hexagonal nanowires, which show erratic topological regions with typically smaller and softer gaps. Our proposal provides a magnetic field-free planar design for quasi-one-dimensional topological superconductivity with attractive properties for experimental control and scalability.",

In this proof-of-principle work we show that the topological regime can be reached in actual devices depending on some geometrical constraints. To this end, we perform numerical simulations of InAs wires in which we explicitly include the superconducting Al and magnetic EuS shells, as well as the interaction with the electrostatic environment at a self-consistent mean-field level. Our calculations show that both the magnetic and the superconducting proximity effects on the nanowire can be tuned by nearby gates thanks to their ability to move the wavefunction across the wire section. We find that the topological phase is achieved in significant portions of the phase diagram only in configurations where the Al and EuS layers overlap on some wire facet, due to the rather local direct induced spin polarization and the appearance of an extra indirect exchange field through the superconductor. While of obvious relevance for the explanation of recent experiments, tunable proximity effects are of interest in the broader field of superconducting spintronics.",

            "summary": "Semiconductor Rashba nanowires are quasi-one dimensional systems that have large spin-orbit (SO) coupling arising from a broken inversion symmetry due to an external electric field. There exist parametrized multiband models that can describe accurately this effect. However, simplified single band models are highly desirable to study geometries of recent experimental interest, since they may allow to incorporate the effects of the low dimensionality and the nanowire electrostatic environment at a reduced computational cost. Commonly used conduction band approximations, valid for bulk materials, greatly underestimate the SO coupling in Zinc-blende crystal structures and overestimate it for Wurtzite ones when applied to finite cross-section wires, where confinement effects turn out to play an important role. We demonstrate here that an effective equation for the linear Rashba SO coupling of the semiconductor conduction band can reproduce the behavior of more sophisticated eight-band k$\\cdot$p model calculations. This is achieved by adjusting a single effective parameter that depends on the nanowire crystal structure and its chemical composition. We further compare our results to the Rashba coupling extracted from magnetoconductance measurements in several experiments on InAs and InSb nanowires, finding excellent agreement. This approach may be relevant in systems where Rashba coupling is known to play a major role, such as in spintronic devices or Majorana nanowires.",

In contrast to partially coated nanowires, it has been argued that full-shell nanowires do not require high magnetic fields and low densities to reach a putative topological regime. Here we present a theoretical study of these devices taking into account all the basic ingredients, including a charge distribution spread across the section of the nanowire, required to qualitatively explain the first experimental results (Vaitiekenas et al., arXiv:1809.05513). We derive a criterion, dependent on the even-odd occupation of the radial subbands with zero angular momentum, for the appearance of Majorana zero modes. In the absence of angular subband mixing, these give rise to strong zero-bias anomalies in tunneling transport in roughly half of the system's parameter space under an odd number of flux quanta. Due to their coexistence with gapless subbands, the zero modes do not enjoy generic topological protection. Depending on the details of subband mixing in realistic devices, they can develop a topological minigap, acquire a finite lifetime or even be destroyed.",

            "summary": "Two-dimensional perovskites, in which inorganic layers are stabilized by organic spacer molecules, are attracting increasing attention as a more robust analogue to the conventional three-dimensional metal-halide perovskites. However, reducing the perovskite dimensionality alters their optoelectronic properties dramatically, yielding excited states that are dominated by bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons, rather than by free charge carriers common to their bulk counterparts. Despite the growing interest in two-dimensional perovskites for both light harvesting and light emitting applications, the full impact of the excitonic nature on their optoelectronic properties remains unclear, particularly regarding the spatial dynamics of the excitons within the two-dimensional (2D) plane. Here, we present direct measurements of in-plane exciton transport in single-crystalline layered perovskites. Using time-resolved fluorescence microscopy, we show that excitons undergo an initial fast, intrinsic normal diffusion through the crystalline plane, followed by a transition to a slower subdiffusive regime as excitons get trapped. Interestingly, the early intrinsic exciton diffusivity depends sensitively on the exact composition of the perovskite, such as the choice of organic spacer. We attribute these changes in exciton transport properties to strong exciton-phonon interactions and the formation of large exciton-polarons. Our findings provide a clear design strategy to optimize exciton transport in these systems.",

It was recently proposed that a periodic covering of the semiconducting nanowire with superconductor fingers would allow both gating and tuning the system into a topological phase while leaving room for a local detection of the MBS wavefunction. We perform a detailed, self-consistent numerical study of a three-dimensional (3D) model for a finite-length nanowire with a superconductor superlattice including the effect of the surrounding electrostatic environment, and taking into account the surface charge created at the semiconductor surface. We consider different experimental scenarios where the superlattice is on top or at the bottom of the nanowire with respect to a back gate. The analysis of the 3D electrostatic profile, the charge density, the low energy spectrum and the formation of MBSs reveals a rich phenomenology that depends on the nanowire parameters as well as on the superlattice dimensions and the external back gate potential. The 3D environment turns out to be essential to correctly capture and understand the phase diagram of the system and the parameter regions where topological superconductivity is established.",

The strain profile modifies the local optoelectronic properties of the alternating compressive and tensile regions, which translates into a remarkable shift of the optical absorption band-edge of up to 1.2 eV between crests and valleys. Our experimental observations are supported by theoretical results from density functional theory calculations performed for monolayers and multilayers (up to 7 layers) under tensile and compressive strain. This large band gap tunability can be explained through a combined analysis of the elastic response of Ga atoms to strain and the symmetry of the wave functions.",

Bubbles ubiquitously form in two-dimensional crystals on top of a substrate by the competition between van der Waals forces and the hydrostatic pressure exerted by trapped fluid. This leads to strong strain at the center of the bubble that reduces the bangap locally, creating potential wells for the electrons that confine states inside. We simulate the spectrum versus the bubble radius for the four semiconducting group VI TMDs, MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$, WS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, and find an overall Fock-Darwin spectrum of bubble bound states, characterised by small deviations compatible with Berry curvature effects. We analyse the density of states, the state degeneracies, orbital structure and optical transition rules. Our results show that elastic bubbles in these materials are remarkably efficient at confining photocarriers.",

            "summary": "Majorana modes emerge in non-trivial topological phases at the edges of some specific materials, like proximitized semiconducting nanowires under a external magnetic field. Ideally, they are non-local states that are charge neutral superpositions of electrons and holes. However, in nanowires of realistic length their wave functions overlap and acquire a finite charge that, under certain circumstances, makes them susceptible to interactions, specifically with the image charges that arise in the electrostatic environment. Considering a realistic three-dimensional model of the dielectric surroundings, here we show that this interaction leads to a suppression of the Majorana oscillations predicted by simpler theoretical models, and to the formation of low-energy quantum dot states that interact with the Majorana modes. Both features are observed in recent experiments on the detection of Majoranas and could thus help to properly characterize them.",

            "summary": "Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit coupling are arguably becoming the leading platform for the search of Majorana bound states (MBSs) in engineered topological superconductors. We perform a systematic numerical study of the low-energy Andreev spectrum and supercurrents in short and long superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions made of nanowires with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, where an external Zeeman field is applied perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis. In particular, we investigate the detailed evolution of the Andreev bound states from the trivial into the topological phase and their relation with the emergence of MBSs. Due to finite length, the system hosts four MBSs, two at the inner part of the junction and two at the outer one. They hybridize and give rise to a finite energy splitting at superconducting phase difference $\\phi=\\pi$, a well-visible effect that can be traced back to the evolution of the energy spectrum with the Zeeman field: from the trivial phase with Andreev bound states into the topological phase with MBSs. Similarly, we carry out a detailed study of supercurrents for short and long junctions from the trivial to the topological phases. The supercurrent, calculated from the Andreev spectrum, is $2\\pi$-periodic in the trivial and topological phases. In the latter it exhibits a clear \\emph{sawtooth} profile at phase difference of $\\pi$ when the energy splitting is negligible, signalling a strong dependence of current-phase curves on the length of the superconducting regions. Effects of temperature, scalar disorder and reduction of normal transmission on supercurrents are also discussed. Further, we identify the individual contribution of MBSs. In short junctions the MBSs determine the current-phase curves, while in long junctions the spectrum above the gap (quasi-continuum) introduces an important contribution.",

We focus, in particular, on the role of confinement effects in long ballistic junctions. In the normal regime, scattering at the two contacts gives rise to two distinct features in conductance, Fabry-Perot resonances and Fano dips. The latter arise in the presence of a strong Zeeman field $B$ that removes a spin sector in the leads (\\emph{helical} leads), but not in the central region. Conversely, a helical central region between non-helical leads exhibits helical gaps of half-quantum conductance, with superimposed helical Fabry-Perot oscillations. These normal features translate into distinct subgap states when the leads become superconducting. In particular, Fabry-Perot resonances within the helical gap become parity-protected zero-energy states (parity crossings), well below the critical field $B_c$ at which the superconducting leads become topological. As a function of Zeeman field or Fermi energy, these zero-modes oscillate around zero energy, forming characteristic loops, which evolve continuously into Majorana bound states as $B$ exceeds $B_c$. The relation with the physics of parity crossings of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states is discussed.",

A modification of the mechanical exfoliation method, which provides higher yield of atomically thin flakes than conventional mechanical exfoliation, has been developed. We present general guidelines to determine the number of layers using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy in a fast and reliable way. Moreover, we demonstrate that the exfoliated flakes are highly crystalline and that they are stable even in free-standing form through Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements. A strong thickness dependence of the band structure is found by density functional theory calculations. The exciton binding energy, within an effective mass approximation, is also calculated for different number of layers. Our computational results for the optical gap are consistent with preliminary photoluminescence results on thin flakes. Finally, we study the environmental stability of black phosphorus flakes finding that the flakes are very hydrophilic and that long term exposure to air moisture etches black phosphorus away. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the aging of the flakes is slow enough to allow fabrication of field-effect transistors with strong ambipolar behavior. Density functional theory calculations also give us insight into the water-induced changes of the structural and electronic properties of black phosphorus.",

For a clean graphene ribbon, the transmission of the topological edge states through a n-n or p-p junction is perfect irrespective of the ribbon termination, width, and potential step parameters due to the orthogonality of incoming and outgoing edge channels. This is shown numerically for an arbitrary crystallographic orientation of the ribbon and proven analytically for zigzag and metallic armchair boundary conditions. In disordered ribbons, the orthogonality between left- and right-movers is in general destroyed and backscattering sets in. However, transmission approaches one by increasing the ribbon's width, even in the presence of strong edge roughness.",

In HgTe quantum wells the asymmetry is the opposite for each spin, whereas for graphene multilayers it is the opposite for each valley degree of freedom. In both cases, a spin/valley current flowing in the perpendicular direction to the applied field is produced.

            "summary": "We propose a new type of quantum pump made out of graphene, adiabatically driven by oscillating voltages applied to two back gates. From a practical point of view, graphene-based quantum pumps present advantages as compared to normal pumps, like enhanced robustness against thermal effects and a wider adiabatic range in driving frequency. From a fundamental point of view, apart from conventional pumping through propagating modes, graphene pumps can tap into evanescent modes, which penetrate deeply into the device as a consequence of chirality. At the Dirac point the evanescent modes dominate pumping and give rise to a universal response under weak driving for short and wide pumps, even though the charge per unit cycle in not quantized.",

            "summary": "We consider bilayer graphene in the presence of spin orbit coupling, to assess its behavior as a topological insulator. The first Chern number $n$ for the energy bands of single and bilayer graphene is computed and compared. It is shown that for a given valley and spin, $n$ in a bilayer is doubled with respect to the monolayer. This implies that bilayer graphene will have twice as many edge states as single layer graphene, which we confirm with numerical calculations and analytically in the case of an armchair terminated surface. Bilayer graphene is a weak topological insulator, whose surface spectrum is susceptible to gap opening under spin-mixing perturbations. We also assess the stability of the associated topological bulk state of bilayer graphene under various perturbations. Finally, we consider an intermediate situation in which only one of the two layers has spin orbit coupling, and find that although individual valleys have non-trivial Chern numbers, the spectrum as a whole is not gapped, so that the system is not a topological insulator.",

No dependence on the magnetic field is observed at the Dirac point for any current cumulant, just as in a classical diffusive system, both in normal-graphene-normal and normal-graphene-superconductor junctions. This pseudo-diffusive regime is however extremely fragile respect to doping at finite fields. We identify the crossovers to a field-suppressed and a normal ballistic transport regime in the magnetic field - doping parameter space, and provide a physical interpretation of the phase diagram. Remarkably, pseudo-diffusive transport is recovered away from the Dirac point in resonance with Landau levels at high magnetic fields.",

Resonant levels are tuned to selectively transmit electrons with specific values of the perpendicular energy, thus fixing the magnitude of the exit angle. When the normal metal is a ballistic two-dimensional electron gas, the proposed scheme guarantees arbitrarily large spatial separation of the entangled electron beams emitted from a finite interface. We perform a quantitative study of the linear and nonlinear transport properties of some suitable structures, taking into account the large mismatch in effective masses and Fermi wavelengths. Numerical estimates confirm the feasibility of the proposed beam separation method.",

Our setup consists of an entangler that emits a flux of entangled electrons into two conductors characterized by a scattering matrix and subject to decoherence. Loss of phase memory is modeled phenomenologically by introducing fictitious extra leads. The outgoing electrons are detected using spin-sensitive electron counters. Given a certain average number of incoming entangled electrons, the CH inequality is evaluated as a function of the numbers of detected particles and on the various quantities characterizing the scattering matrix. When decoherence is turned on, we show that the amount of violation of the CH inequality is effectively reduced. Interestingly we find that, by adjusting the parameters of the system, there exists a protected region of $Q$ values for which violation holds for arbitrary strong decoherence.",

            "summary": "We investigate theoretically the simultaneous tunneling of two electrons from a superconductor into a normal metal at low temperatures and voltages. Such an emission process is shown to be equivalent to the Andreev reflection of an incident hole. We obtain a local tunneling Hamiltonian that permits to investigate transport through interfaces of arbitrary geometry and potential barrier shapes. We prove that the bilinear momentum dependence of the low-energy tunneling matrix element translates into a real space Hamiltonian involving the normal derivatives of the electron fields in each electrode. The angular distribution of the electron current as it is emitted into the normal metal is analyzed for various experimental setups. We show that, in a full three-dimensional problem, the neglect of the momentum dependence of tunneling causes a violation of unitarity and leads to the wrong thermodynamic (broad interface) limit. More importantly for current research on quantum information devices, in the case of an interface made of two narrow tunneling contacts separated by a distance $r$, the assumption of momentum-independent hopping yields a nonlocally entangled electron current that decays with a prefactor proportional to $r^{-2}$ instead of the correct $r^{-4}$.",

            "summary": "Traditional x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) relies upon a direct mapping between the photoelectron binding energies and the local chemical environment, which is well-characterized by an electrostatic partial charges model for systems in equilibrium. However, the extension of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems has been hampered by the lack of x-ray sources capable of accessing multiple atomic sites with high spectral and temporal resolution, as well as the lack of simple theoretical procedures to interpret the observed signals. In this work we employ multi-site XPS with a narrowband femtosecond x-ray probe to unravel different ultrafast dissociation processes of a polyatomic molecule, fluoromethane (CH$_{3}$F). We show that XPS can follow the cleavage of both the C-F and C-H bonds in real time, despite these channels lying close in binding energy. Additionally, we apply the partial charges model to describe these dynamics, and verify this extension with both advanced ab-initio calculations and experimental data. These results enable the application of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems of higher complexity, by correlating real-time information from multiple atomic sites and interpreting the measurements through a viable theoretical modelling.",

            "summary": "Recently, the isolation of 2D magnetic materials has opened several avenues for possible new ap- plications in spintronics. Among these materials, CrSBr has sparked interest due to its relatively high Curie temperature, highly anisotropic lattice structure, and high structural stability. These properties ran along others shared by any atomically thin material such as its outstanding defor- mation capacity and a strong optical response dominated by excitonic effects. The combination of these properties provides a fairly uncharted playground where to explore the interplay between magnetism and optical excitations. Here, we focus our attention on the theoretical optical response of CrSBr under several distinct strain configurations, analyzing the resulting changes to both the excitonic peaks and overall shape of the diagonal components of the linear conductivity tensor.",

            "summary": "Valleytronics, as an alternative to traditional electronics or spintronics, is based on the encoding of quantum information in pseudospin valley quantum numbers, rather than in charge or spin states. A key ingredient is the (optical) manipulation of valley states before loss of coherence, which can be as fast as 100 femtoseconds. Previous works have shown the possibility of valley state manipulation using external fields. Here we propose uniaxial strain as a more flexible and robust scheme to manipulate the valley state through the breaking of the crystal symmetry and the concomitant lifting of the degeneracy of the 1s exciton energy. Our theory is corroborated by state-of-the-art numerical simulations in monolayer hBN and shows the possibility to control valley pseudospin at the attosecond time scale.",

In particular, we use an ultrafast scheme with a circularly polarized IR pump pulse and an attosecond x-ray probe pulse. A laser-induced dichroism-type spectrum shows a clear signature of the topological phase transition. We are able to connect these signatures with the Berry structure of the system.

These are bound states showing up in the band gaps of many-body systems and are conceived as quasiparticles formed by an electron and a hole. By performing real-time simulations in hBN, we show that an ultrashort (few-fs) UV pulse can produce a coherent superposition of excitonic states that induces an oscillatory motion of electrons and holes between different valleys in reciprocal space, leading to a sizeable exciton migration in real space. We also show that an ultrafast spectroscopy scheme based on the absorption of an attosecond pulse in combination with the UV pulse can be used to read out the laser-induced coherences, hence to extract the characteristic time for exciton migration. This work opens the door towards ultrafast electronics and valleytronics adding time as a control knob and exploiting electron coherence at the early times of excitation.",

            "summary": "This paper has been prepared by the Symphony collaboration (University of Warsaw, Uniwersytet Jagiello\\'nski, DESY/CNR and ICFO) on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the \"simple man's models\" which underlie most of the phenomena that occur when intense ultrashort laser pulses interact with matter. The phenomena in question include High-Harmonic Generation, Above-Threshold Ionization, and Non-Sequential Multielectron Ionization. \"Simple man's models\" provide, both an intuitive basis for understanding the numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation, and the motivation for the powerful analytic approximations generally known as the Strong Field Approximation (SFA). In this paper we first review the SFA in the form developed by us in the last 25 years. In this approach SFA is a method to solve the TDSE using a systematic perturbation theory in a part of the Hamiltonian describing continuum-continuum transitions in the presence of the laser field. In this review we focus on recent applications of SFA to HHG, ATI and NSMI from multi-electron atoms and from multi-atom. The main novel part of the presented theory concerns generalizations of SFA to: (i) time-dependent treatment of two-electron atoms, allowing for studies of an interplay between Electron Impact Ionization (EII) and Resonant Excitation with Subsequent Ionization (RESI); (ii) time-dependent treatment in the single active electron (SAE) approximation of \"large\" molecules and targets which are themselves undergoing dynamics during the HHG or ATI process. In particular, we formulate the general expressions for the case of arbitrary molecules, combining input from quantum chemistry and quantum dynamics. We formulate also theory of time-dependent separable molecular potentials to model analytically the dynamics of realistic electronic wave packets for molecules in strong laser fields.",

            "summary": "Topological materials are of interest to both fundamental science and advanced technologies, because topological states are robust with respect to perturbations and dissipation. Experimental detection of topological invariants is thus in great demand, but it remains extremely challenging. Ultrafast laser-matter interactions, and in particular high-harmonic generation (HHG), meanwhile, were proposed several years ago as tools to explore the structural and dynamical properties of various matter targets. Here we show that the high-harmonic emission signal produced by a circularly-polarized laser contains signatures of the topological phase transition in the paradigmatic Haldane model. In addition to clear shifts of the overall emissivity and harmonic cutoff, the high-harmonic emission shows a unique circular dichroism, which exhibits clear changes in behavior at the topological phase boundary. Our findings pave the way to understand fundamental questions about the ultrafast electron-hole pair dynamics in topological materials via non-linear high-harmonic generation spectroscopy.",

            "summary": "High-order harmonic generation stands as a unique nonlinear optical up-conversion process, mediated by a laser-driven electron recollision mechanism, which has been shown to conserve energy, momentum, and spin and orbital angular momentum. Here we present theoretical simulations which demonstrate that this process also conserves a mixture of the latter, the torus-knot angular momentum $J_\\gamma$, by producing high-order harmonics with driving pulses that are invariant under coordinated rotations. We demonstrate that the charge $J_\\gamma$ of the emitted harmonics scales linearly with the harmonic order, and that this conservation law is imprinted onto the polarization distribution of the emitted spiral of attosecond pulses. We also demonstrate how the nonperturbative physics of high-order harmonic generation affect the torus-knot angular momentum of the harmonics, and we show that this configuration harnesses the spin selection rules to channel the full yield of each harmonic into a single mode of controllable orbital angular momentum.",

            "summary": "The fundamental polarization singularities of monochromatic light are normally associated with invariance under coordinated rotations: symmetry operations that rotate the spatial dependence of an electromagnetic field by an angle $\\theta$ and its polarization by a multiple $\\gamma\\theta$ of that angle. These symmetries are generated by mixed angular momenta of the form $J_\\gamma = L + \\gamma S$ and they generally induce M\\\"obius-strip topologies, with the coordination parameter $\\gamma$ restricted to integer and half-integer values. In this work we construct beams of light that are invariant under coordinated rotations for arbitrary $\\gamma$, by exploiting the higher internal symmetry of 'bicircular' superpositions of counter-rotating circularly polarized beams at different frequencies. We show that these beams have the topology of a torus knot, which reflects the subgroup generated by the torus-knot angular momentum $J_\\gamma$, and we characterize the resulting optical polarization singularity using third-and higher-order field moment tensors, which we experimentally observe using nonlinear polarization tomography.",

            "summary": "Novel perspectives of controlling molecular systems have recently arisen from the possibility of generating attosecond pulses in the ultraviolet regime and tailoring electron dynamics in its natural time scale. The cornerstone mechanism is the so-called charge migration, he production of a coherent charge transfer with subfemtosecond oscillations across a molecule. Typically, charge migration is induced by the ionization of valence molecular orbitals. However, recent technological developments allow the generation of attosecond pulses in the x-ray regime. In this case, the absorption of photons creates core-hole states. In light elements, core-hole states mainly decay by Auger processes that, driven by electron correlations, involve valence orbitals. We theoretically demonstrate in a fluoroacetylene molecule a double-hole charge migration triggered by attosecond core-electron photoionization, followed by Auger electron relaxations. This opens a new route for inducing with x rays charge transfer processes in the subfemtosecond time scale.",

            "summary": "The capability of generating two intense, femtosecond x-ray pulses with controlled time delay opens the possibility of performing time-resolved experiments for x-ray induced phenomena. We have applied this capability to study the photoinduced dynamics in diatomic molecules. In molecules composed of low-Z elements, \\textit{K}-shell ionization creates a core-hole state in which the main decay mode is an Auger process involving two electrons in the valence shell. After Auger decay, the nuclear wavepackets of the transient two-valence-hole states continue evolving on the femtosecond timescale, leading either to separated atomic ions or long-lived quasi-bound states. By using an x-ray pump and an x-ray probe pulse tuned above the \\textit{K}-shell ionization threshold of the nitrogen molecule, we are able to observe ion dissociation in progress by measuring the time-dependent kinetic energy releases of different breakup channels. We simulated the measurements on N$_2$ with a molecular dynamics model that accounts for \\textit{K}-shell ionization, Auger decay, and the time evolution of the nuclear wavepackets. In addition to explaining the time-dependent feature in the measured kinetic energy release distributions from the dissociative states, the simulation also reveals the contributions of quasi-bound states.",

X rays primarily interact with inner-shell electrons creating core (inner-shell) holes that will decay on the time scale of attoseconds to few femtoseconds through electron relaxations involving the emission of a photon or an electron. The advent of femtosecond x-ray pulses expands x-ray spectroscopy to the time domain and will eventually allow the control of core-hole population on timescales comparable to core-vacancy lifetimes. For both cases, a theoretical approach that accounts for the x-ray interaction while the electron relaxations occur is required.

The Xe 3d - $\\epsilon$f continuum shape resonances dominate the photoionization cross sections of both the atom and molecule, but prominent resonances appear in the XeF$_2$ cross section due to nominal excitation of Xe 3d and F 1s electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), a delocalized anti-bonding MO. The subshell ionization thresholds, the LUMO resonance energies and their oscillator strengths are calculated by relativistic coupled-cluster methods. Several charge states and fragment ions are produced from the atom and molecule due to alternative decay pathways from the inner-shell holes. Total and partial ion yields vary in response to the shape resonances and LUMO resonances. Previous calculations and measurements of atomic Xe 3d core-hole decay channels and our calculated results for XeF$_2$ guide interpretations of the molecular ion products. The partial ion yields of XeF$_2$ are dominated by Xe 3d core-hole decays, but distinct ion products are measured at the F 1s - LUMO resonance. Xe 3d core-hole decays from XeF$_2$ produce lower charge states in comparison with atomic Xe, and energetic F ions are produced by Coulomb explosions of the molecular ions. The measurements support a model of molecular core-hole decay that begins with a localized hole, stepwise Auger electron emission spreads charge across neighboring atoms, and the system fragments energetically.",

            "summary": "We have unveiled coherent multiphoton interferences originating from different quantum paths taken by the Auger electron induced by a high-intensity x-ray/XUV pulse under the presence of a strong optical field. These interferences give rise to a clear signature in the angle-resolved Auger electron spectrum: an asymmetry with respect to the energy of the Auger decay channel. In order to illustrate this effect we have considered the resonant Auger decay of the transition $2p^{5} \\!\\leftrightarrow\\! 1s^{-1}2p^{6}$ in Ne$^{+}$. The simulations show that these interferences are very sensitive to the parameters of the x-ray and optical fields.",

Our theoretical analysis and results of numerical simulations for the interaction of the hydrogen molecular ion in its electronic ground state with an infrared laser pulse reveal a selective two-photon transition between the vibrational states via a coupling with the first excited dissociative state. We demonstrate that for a given temporal intensity profile the population transfer between vibrational states, or a superposition of vibrational states, can be made complete for a single chirped pulse or a train of chirped pulses, which accounts for the accumulated phase difference due to the AC Stark effect. Effects of a spatial intensity (or, focal) averaging are discussed.",

            "summary": "We analyze two-center interference effects in the yields of ionization of a dissociating hydrogen molecular ion by an ultrashort VUV laser pulse. To this end, we performed numerical simulations of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for a H$_2^+$ model ion interacting with two time-delayed laser pulses. The scenario considered corresponds to a pump-probe scheme, in which the first (pump) pulse excites the molecular ion to the first excited dissociative state and the second (probe) pulse ionizes the electron as the ion dissociates. The results of our numerical simulations for the ionization yield as a function of the time delay between the two pulses exhibit characteristic oscillations due to interferences between the partial electron waves emerging from the two protons in the dissociating hydrogen molecular ion. We show that the photon energy of the pump pulse should be in resonance with the $\\sigma_g - \\sigma_u$ transition and the pump pulse duration should not exceed 5 fs in order to generate a well confined nuclear wavepacket. The spreading of the nuclear wavepacket during the dissociation is found to cause a decrease of the amplitudes of the oscillations as the time delay increases. We develop an analytical model to fit the oscillations and show how dynamic information about the nuclear wavepacket, namely velocity, mean internuclear distance and spreading, can be retrieved from the oscillations. The predictions of the analytical model are tested well against the results of our numerical simulations.",

We show that the apparently complex spectral structure can be completely described by two families: harmonic frequencies of the driving field and field-induced nonlinear fluorescence. Our formulation of the problem provides quantitative laws for the most relevant spectral features: harmonic ratios and phases, non-perturbative Stark shift, and frequency limits of the harmonic plateau. In particular, we demonstrate the locking of the harmonic phases at the wings of the plateau opening the possibility of ultra-short pulse generation through harmonic filtering.",

In all cases, so far, photons were assumed to carry one unit of angular momentum. However it is now clear that photons can possess extra angular momentum, the orbital angular momentum (OAM), related to their spatial profile. We show a complete description of photoionization by OAM photons, including new selection rules involving more than one unit of angular momentum. We explore theoretically the interaction of a single electron atom located at the center of an intense ultraviolet beam bearing OAM, envisaging new scenarios for quantum optics.",

            "summary": "We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional entanglement.",

OTA and tr‐XAS of 1 and 2 show that the favored catalytic pathway involves reductive quenching of the excited photosensitizer and electron transfer to the catalyst to form a CoII square pyramidal intermediate with a bonded aqua molecule followed by a CoI square planar derivative that decays within ≈8 μs. By contrast, a CoI square pyramidal intermediate with a longer decay lifetime of ≈35 μs is formed from an analogous CoII geometry for 3 in H2O. These results highlight the protonation of CoI to form the elusive hydride species to be the rate limiting step and show that the catalytic rate can be enhanced through hydrogen containing pendant amines that act as H−H bond formation proton relays.",

Here we demonstrate the ability to initiate and track the ultrafast electron rearrangement and chemical bond breaking site-specifically in real time for the carbon monoxide diatomic molecule. We employ a local resonant x-ray pump at the oxygen atom and probe the chemical shifts of the carbon core-electron binding energy. We observe charge redistribution accompanying core-excitation followed by Auger decay, eventually leading to dissociation and hole trapping at one site of the molecule. The presented technique is general in nature with sensitivity to chemical environment changes including transient electronic excited state dynamics. This work provides a route to investigate energy and charge transport processes in more complex systems by tracking selective chemical bond changes on their natural timescale.",

            "summary": "Recent developments in attosecond technology led to table-top x-ray spectroscopy in the soft x-ray range, thus uniting the element- and state-specificity of core-level x-ray absorption spectroscopy with the time resolution to follow electronic dynamics in real-time. We describe recent work in attosecond technology and investigations into materials such as Si, SiO2, GaN, Al2O3, Ti, and TiO2, enabled by the convergence of these two capabilities. We showcase the state-of-the-art on isolated attosecond soft x-ray pulses for x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy to observe the 3d-state dynamics of the semi-metal TiS2 with attosecond resolution at the Ti L-edge (460 eV). We describe how the element- and state-specificity at the transition metal L-edge of the quantum material allows us to unambiguously identify how and where the optical field influences charge carriers. This precision elucidates that the Ti:3d conduction band states are efficiently photo-doped to a density of 1.9 × 1021 cm−3. The light-field induces coherent motion of intra-band carriers across 38% of the first Brillouin zone. Lastly, we describe the prospects with such unambiguous real-time observation of carrier dynamics in specific bonding or anti-bonding states and speculate that such capability will bring unprecedented opportunities toward an engineered approach for designer materials with pre-defined properties and efficiency. Examples are composites of semiconductors and insulators like Si, Ge, SiO2, GaN, BN, and quantum materials like graphene, transition metal dichalcogens, or high-Tc superconductors like NbN or LaBaCuO. Exiting are prospects to scrutinize canonical questions in multi-body physics, such as whether the electrons or lattice trigger phase transitions.",

Tr‐XAS analysis after light illumination shows the formation of a seven‐coordinated high‐spin quintet metastable state, which relaxes to a six‐coordinated high‐spin configuration before decaying to the ground state. Kinetic analysis of the macrocyclic complex reveals an unprecedented long‐lived decay lifetime of approximately 42.6 μs. Comparative studies with a non‐macrocyclic counterpart illustrate a significantly shortened approximately 568‐fold decay lifetime of about 75 ns, and highlight the importance of the ligand arrangement in stabilizing the reactivity of the excited state. Lastly, OTA analysis shows the seven‐coordinated high‐spin state to be formed within approximately 6.2 ps. These findings provide a complete understanding of the spin crossover reaction and relaxation pathways of the macrocyclic complex, and reveal the importance of a flexible coordination environment for their rational design.",

            "summary": "Abstract\n               We demonstrate that the standard picture of strong-field tunnel-ionization from molecules should be reformulated. The extended nature of the molecular potential implies the separation of some of the molecular sites from the edge of the ionization barrier. We show that the dependence of the tunnel probability with the distance to the barrier is translated into the ionized wavepacket, modifying substantially the high-order harmonic emission. The introduction of the dependence of tunnel ionization with the molecular site significantly improves the theoretical description of high-order harmonic generation in molecules, which is used as a cornerstone in high-harmonic spectroscopy and attosecond imaging.",

            "summary": "AbstractWe report the light‐induced electronic and geometric changes taking place within a heteroleptic CuI photosensitizer, namely [(xant)Cu(Me2phenPh2)]PF6 (xant=xantphos, Me2phenPh2=bathocuproine), by time‐resolved X‐ray absorption spectroscopy in the ps–μs time regime. Time‐resolved X‐ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X‐ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis enabled the elucidation of the electronic and structural configuration of the copper center in the excited state as well as its decay dynamics in different solvent conditions with and without triethylamine acting as a sacrificial electron donor. A three‐fold decrease in the decay lifetime of the excited state is observed in the presence of triethylamine, showing the feasibility of the reductive quenching pathway in the latter case. A prominent pre‐edge feature is observed in the XANES spectrum of the excited state upon metal to charge ligand transfer transition, showing an increased hybridization of the 3d states with the ligand p orbitals in the tetrahedron around the Cu center. EXAFS and density functional theory illustrate a significant shortening of the Cu−N and an elongation of the Cu−P bonds together with a decrease in the torsional angle between the xantphos and bathocuproine ligand. This study provides mechanistic time‐resolved understanding for the development of improved heteroleptic CuI photosensitizers, which can be used for the light‐driven production of hydrogen from water.",

Recently, OAM has been imprinted to short-wavelength radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), leading to the emission of attosecond twisted beams in the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) regime. We explore the details of the mapping of the driving vortex to its harmonic spectrum. In particular, we show that the geometry of the harmonic vortices is convoluted, arising from the superposition of the contribution from the short and long quantum paths responsible of HHG. Finally, we show how to take advantage of transverse phase-matching to select twisted attosecond beams with different spatiotemporal properties.",

            "summary": "High-harmonic generation from solids can be utilized as a probe of ultrafast dynamics, but thus far only over extended sample areas, since its spatial resolution is diffraction limited. Here, we propose spatial polarization gating, that is, using a spatially varying ellipticity of a driving laser pulse to reduce the spatial profile of high-harmonic emission below the diffraction limit and hence increase spatial resolution. We show experimentally and by numerical simulations that our method is generally applicable as suppressing high harmonics in elliptical fields is a common response in all solids. We also briefly explore the possibility of applying this technique to wide-field imaging, specifically to nonlinear structured illumination microscopy. Our findings indicate that spatial polarization gating can enable all-optical femto-to-attosecond label-free imaging beyond the Abbe limit.",

Due to the Wannier-Stark localization induced on subcycle timescales in the presence of a strong field, real-space descriptions are natural for strongly driven solids. Our approach allows us to address the origin of the extremely short dephasing times, which appear necessary for agreement between experimental HHG measurements and theoretical calculations generally performed in reciprocal space. We develop a physically transparent model of real-space dephasing which relates its rate to the distance between different sites in a laser-driven lattice. Our approach leads to well-structured high harmonic spectra at the microscopic level, reproduces the results of macroscopic propagation, and demonstrates that the requirement for ultrafast dephasing times stems from the need for suppressing recombination events with large electron-hole separations during radiative recombination.\n          \n            \n            \n              \n                Published by the American Physical Society\n                2024",

We find that far-field propagation naturally reduces the contribution to the observed HHG emission from electrons that do not return to the lattice site where they have been injected into the conduction band. We then show that extremely short dephasing times routinely used in microscopic simulations suppress many electron trajectories that contribute to the far-field spectra, leading to significant distortions of the true high harmonic response. We show that a real-space based dephasing mechanism, which preferentially suppresses trajectories that veer too far away from their original lattice site, yields HHG spectra that faithfully retain those trajectories that contribute to the far-field spectra while filtering out those that do not, already at the microscopic level. Our findings emphasize the similarities between atomic and solid-state HHG by highlighting the importance of the intensity-dependent phase of HHG emission and address the longstanding issue regarding the origin of extremely short dephasing times in solid-state HHG.",

We experimentally reveal this phase by using a strong laser field to engineer an internal interferometer, induced during less than one cycle of the driving field, which maps the phase onto the emission of higher-order harmonics. Our work provides an opportunity for the study of geometric phases, leading to a variety of observations in light-driven topological phenomena and attosecond solid-state physics.",

While machine learning and neural networks have been finding applications across many areas of science and technology, their use in decoding ultrafast dynamics of quantum systems driven by strong laser fields has been limited so far. Here we use standard deep neural networks to analyze simulated noisy spectra of highly nonlinear optical response of a 2-dimensional gapped graphene crystal to intense few-cycle laser pulses. We show that a computationally simple 1-dimensional system provides a useful \"nursery school\" for our neural network, allowing it to be retrained to treat more complex 2D systems, recovering the parametrized band structure and spectral phases of the incident few-cycle pulse with high accuracy, in spite of significant amplitude noise and phase jitter. Our results offer a route for attosecond high harmonic spectroscopy of quantum dynamics in solids with a simultaneous, all-optical, solid-state based complete characterization of few-cycle pulses, including their nonlinear spectral phase and the carrier envelope phase.",

It has been shown that shining circularly-polarized light allows to achieve close to 100% of valley polarization, opening the way to valley-based transistors. Yet, switching of the valley polarization is still a key challenge for the practical implementation of such devices due to the short valley lifetimes. Recent progress in ultrashort laser technology now allows to produce trains of attosecond pulses with controlled phase and polarization between the pulses. Taking advantage of such technology, we introduce a coherent control protocol to turn on, off and switch the valley polarization at faster timescales than electron-hole decoherence and valley depolarization, that is, an ultrafast optical valley switch. We theoretically demonstrate the protocol for hBN and MoS2 monolayers calculated from first principles. Additionally, using two time-delayed linearly-polarized pulses with perpendicular polarization, we show that we can extract the electronic dephasing time T2 from the valley Hall conductivity.",

            "summary": "AbstractConventional approaches to probing ultrafast molecular dynamics rely on the use of synchronized laser pulses with a well-defined time delay. Typically, a pump pulse excites a molecular wavepacket. A subsequent probe pulse can then dissociate or ionize the molecule, and measurement of the molecular fragments provides information about where the wavepacket was for each time delay. Here, we propose to exploit the ultrafast nuclear-position-dependent emission obtained due to large light–matter coupling in plasmonic nanocavities to image wavepacket dynamics using only a single pump pulse. We show that the time-resolved emission from the cavity provides information about when the wavepacket passes a given region in nuclear configuration space. This approach can image both cavity-modified dynamics on polaritonic (hybrid light–matter) potentials in the strong light–matter coupling regime and bare-molecule dynamics in the intermediate coupling regime of large Purcell enhancements, and provides a route towards ultrafast molecular spectroscopy with plasmonic nanocavities.",

            "summary": "Strong coupling of quantum emitters with confined electromagnetic modes of nanophotonic structures may be used to change optical, chemical, and transport properties of materials, with significant theoretical effort invested toward a better understanding of this phenomenon. However, a full theoretical description of both matter and light is an extremely challenging task. Typical theoretical approaches simplify the description of the photonic environment by describing it as a single mode or few modes. While this approximation is accurate in some cases, it breaks down strongly in complex environments, such as within plasmonic nanocavities, and the electromagnetic environment must be fully taken into account. This requires the quantum description of a continuum of bosonic modes, a problem that is computationally hard. We here investigate a compromise where the quantum character of light is taken into account at modest computational cost. To do so, we focus on a quantum emitter that interacts with an arbitrary photonic spectral density and employ the cumulant, or cluster, expansion method to the Heisenberg equations of motion up to first, second, and third order. We benchmark the method by comparing it with exact solutions for specific situations and show that it can accurately represent dynamics for many parameter ranges.",

            "summary": "AbstractIsotropic gases irradiated by long pulses of intense IR light can generate very high harmonics of the incident field. It is generally accepted that, due to the symmetry of the generating medium, be it an atomic or an isotropic molecular gas, only odd harmonics of the driving field can be produced. Here we show how the interplay of electronic and nuclear dynamics can lead to a marked breakdown of this standard picture: a substantial part of the harmonic spectrum can consist of even rather than odd harmonics. We demonstrate the effect using ab-initio solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for \"Equation missing\" and its isotopes in full dimensionality. By means of a simple analytical model, we identify its physical origin, which is the appearance of a permanent dipole moment in dissociating homonuclear molecules, caused by light-induced localization of the electric charge during dissociation. The effect arises for sufficiently long laser pulses and the region of the spectrum where even harmonics are produced is controlled by pulse duration. Our results (i) show how the interplay of femtosecond nuclear and attosecond electronic dynamics, which affects the charge flow inside the dissociating molecule, is reflected in the nonlinear response, and (ii) force one to augment standard selection rules found in nonlinear optics textbooks by considering light-induced modifications of the medium during the generation process.",

            "summary": "The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials.",

            "summary": "Intense light-matter interactions have revolutionized our ability to probe and manipulate quantum systems at sub-femtosecond time scales, opening routes to all-optical control of electronic currents in solids at petahertz rates. Such control typically requires electric field amplitudes $\\sim V/\\AA$, when the voltage drop across a lattice site becomes comparable to the characteristic band gap energies. In this regime, intense light-matter interaction induces significant modifications of electronic and optical properties, dramatically modifying the crystal band structure. Yet, identifying and characterizing such modifications remains an outstanding problem. As the oscillating electric field changes within the driving field's cycle, does the band-structure follow, and how can it be defined? Here we address this fundamental question, proposing all-optical spectroscopy to probe laser-induced closing of the band-gap between adjacent conduction bands. Our work reveals the link between nonlinear light matter interactions in strongly driven crystals and the sub-cycle modifications in their effective band structure.",

            "summary": "High-harmonic generation in solids allows probing and controlling electron dynamics in crystals on few femtosecond timescales, paving the way to lightwave electronics. In the spatial domain, recent advances in the real-space interpretation of high-harmonic emission in solids allows imaging the field-free, static, potential of the valence electrons with picometer resolution. The combination of such extreme spatial and temporal resolutions to measure and control strong-field dynamics in solids at the atomic scale is poised to unlock a new frontier of lightwave electronics. Here, we report a strong intensity-dependent anisotropy in the high-harmonic generation from ReS$_2$ that we attribute to angle-dependent interference of currents from the different atoms in the unit cell. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the laser parameters control the relative contribution of these atoms to the high-harmonic emission. Our findings provide an unprecedented atomic perspective on strong-field dynamics in crystals and suggest that crystals with a large number of atoms in the unit cell are not necessarily more efficient harmonic emitters than those with fewer atoms.",

            "summary": "The reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBIT) is one of the most widely used techniques for obtaining both the relative phases of harmonics forming an attosecond pulse train and the phase of atomic radiative transitions. If the latter is computed by theory, it allows to reconstruct the attosecond pulse train; if the former is known experimentally, it allows reconstruction of the electronic dynamics of photoionization in atomic and molecular systems with attosecond temporal resolution. As it relies on the interference of photo-electrons in vacuum, similar interference has never been contemplated inside crystals. Here we explore the applicability of this scheme to solid-state systems using a one-dimensional model and a DFT-calculated structure of 2D hexagonal boron nitride. We discuss the possibility of: (i) reconstructing the relative phases between harmonics with trivial influence of the 'atomic phase', (ii) retrieving the relative phases of two-photon transitions through different bands, which are generally challenging to obtain both experimentally and numerically. These phases are recorded in the beating of the population signal arising from interfering two-photon pathways, and can be read-out with angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the amplitude of the population beating decays as the pump and probe pulses are separated in time due to electron-hole decoherence, providing a simple interferometric method to extract dephasing times.",

While machine learning and neural networks have been finding applications across many areas of science and technology, their use in decoding ultrafast dynamics of quantum systems driven by strong laser fields has been limited so far. Here we use deep neural networks to analyze simulated noisy spectra of highly nonlinear optical response of a 2-dimensional gapped graphene crystal to intense few-cycle laser pulses. We show that a computationally simple 1-dimensional system provides a useful \"nursery school\" for our neural network, allowing it to be easily retrained to treat more complex systems, recovering the band structure and spectral phases of the incident few-cycle pulse with high accuracy, in spite of significant amplitude noise and phase jitter. Our results both offer a new tool for attosecond spectroscopy of quantum dynamics in solids and also open a route to developing all-solid-state devices for complete characterization of few-cycle pulses, including their nonlinear chirp and the carrier envelope phase.",

We theoretically demonstrate a way to induce, control, and read valley polarization in hexagonal 2D materials on a few-femtosecond timescale using a few-cycle, linearly polarized pulse with controlled carrier-envelope phase. The valley pseudospin is encoded in the helicity of the emitted high harmonics of the driving pulse, allowing one to avoid additional probe pulses and permitting one to induce, manipulate and read the valley pseudospin all-optically, in one step.

Optical tunneling and high harmonic generation are the hallmarks of attosecond imaging in optical domain, including imaging of phase transitions in solids. Topological phase transition yields a state of matter intimately linked with electron dynamics, as manifested via the chiral edge currents in topological insulators. Does topological state of matter leave its mark on optical tunneling and sub-cycle electronic response? We identify distinct topological effects on the directionality and the attosecond timing of currents arising during electron injection into conduction bands. We show that electrons tunnel across the band gap differently in trivial and topological phases, for the same band structure, and identify the key role of the Berry curvature in this process. These effects map onto topologically-dependent attosecond delays in high harmonic emission and the helicities of the emitted harmonics, which can record the phase diagram of the system and its topological invariants. Thus, the topological state of the system controls its attosecond, highly non-equilibrium electronic response to strong low-frequency laser fields, in bulk. Our findings create new roadmaps in studies of topological systems, building on ubiquitous properties of sub-laser cycle strong field response - a unique mark of attosecond science.",

            "summary": "The bi-circular scheme for high harmonic generation, which combines two counter-rotating circular fields with frequency ratio 2:1, has recently permitted to generate high harmonics with essentially circular polarization, opening the way for ultrafast chiral studies. This scheme produces harmonic lines at 3N + 1 and 3N + 2 multiples of the fundamental driving frequency, while the 3N lines are forbidden owing to the three-fold symmetry of the field. It is generally established that the routinely observed signals at these forbidden harmonic lines come from a slight ellipticity in the driving fields, which breaks the three-fold symmetry. We find that this is neither the only nor it is the dominant mechanism responsible. The forbidden lines can be observed even for perfectly circular, long driving pulses. We show that they encode rich information on the sub-cycle electronic dynamics that occur during the generation process. By varying the time delay and relative intensity between the two drivers, we demonstrate that when the second harmonic either precedes or is more intense than the fundamental field, the dynamical symmetry of the system is broken by electrons trapped in Rydberg orbits (i.e., Freeman resonances), and that the forbidden harmonic lines are a witness of this.",

The feasibility of engineering quantum Hamiltonians with photonic tools, combined with the availability of entangled photons, raises the intriguing possibility of employing topologically protected entangled states in optical quantum computing and information processing. However, while two-photon states built as a product of two topologically protected single-photon states inherit full protection from their single-photon “parents”, a high degree of non-separability may lead to rapid deterioration of the two-photon states after propagation through disorder. In this work, we identify physical mechanisms which contribute to the vulnerability of entangled states in topological photonic lattices. Further, we show that in order to maximize entanglement without sacrificing topological protection, the joint spectral correlation map of two-photon states must fit inside a well-defined topological window of protection.",

Valley-selective excitations, governed by the circularly polarized light resonant with the material’s bandgap, are the foundation of valleytronics. It is often assumed that achieving valley selective excitation in pristine graphene with all-optical means is not possible due to the inversion symmetry of the system. Here, we demonstrate that both valley-selective excitation and valley-selective high-harmonic generation can be achieved in pristine graphene by using a combination of two counter-rotating circularly polarized fields, the fundamental and its second harmonic. Controlling the relative phase between the two colors allows us to select the valleys where the electron–hole pairs and higher-order harmonics are generated. We also describe an all-optical method for measuring valley polarization in graphene with a weak probe pulse. This work offers a robust recipe to write and read valley-selective electron excitations in materials with zero bandgap and zero Berry curvature.",

The process of autoionization, induced by resonant excitation of electrons into discrete states present in the spectral continuum of atomic and molecular targets, is mediated by electron correlation. Here we investigate the attosecond photoemission dynamics in argon in the 20–40 eV spectral range, in the vicinity of the 3s−1np autoionizing resonances. We present measurements of the differential photoionization cross section and extract energy and angle-dependent atomic time delays with an attosecond interferometric method. With the support of a theoretical model, we are able to attribute a large part of the measured time delay anisotropy to the presence of autoionizing resonances, which not only distort the phase of the emitted photoelectron wave packet but also introduce an angular dependence.",

Such pulses hold the potential for time-resolving chiral electronic, magnetization, and spin dynamics at their natural timescale. However, this potential cannot be realized without characterizing the exact polarization state of light on the attosecond timescale. Here we propose and numerically demonstrate a complete solution of this problem. Our solution exploits the extrinsic two-dimensional chirality induced in an atom interacting with the chiral attosecond pulse and a linearly polarized infrared probe. The resulting asymmetry in the photoelectron spectra allows to reconstruct the complete polarization state of the attosecond pulse, including its possible time dependence. The challenging problem of distinguishing circularly polarized, partially polarized, or unpolarized pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range is also resolved. We expect this approach to become the core ingredient for attosecond measurements of chiral-sensitive processes in gas and condensed phase.",

            "summary": "AbstractElectron dynamics induced by resonant absorption of light is of fundamental importance in nature and has been the subject of countless studies in many scientific areas. Above the ionization threshold of atomic or molecular systems, the presence of discrete states leads to autoionization, which is an interference between two quantum paths: direct ionization and excitation of the discrete state coupled to the continuum. Traditionally studied with synchrotron radiation, the probability for autoionization exhibits a universal Fano intensity profile as a function of excitation energy. However, without additional phase information, the full temporal dynamics cannot be recovered. Here we use tunable attosecond pulses combined with weak infrared radiation in an interferometric setup to measure not only the intensity but also the phase variation of the photoionization amplitude across an autoionization resonance in argon. The phase variation can be used as a fingerprint of the interactions between the discrete state and the ionization continua, indicating a new route towards monitoring electron correlations in time.",

We show how, using a THz pulse, we can induce a transient electronic orientation in a medium of randomly oriented chiral molecules that breaks the isotropy of the molecular sample. This symmetry breaking twists the nonlinear response of the medium to an ultrashort linearly polarised optical pulse in a highly enantiosensitive manner. As a result, the medium emits elliptically polarised light at new optical frequencies that records the molecular handedness via purely electric-dipole interactions. The long wavelength and period of the THz pulse enable both spatial coherence across the sample and a substantial degree of electronic orientation over the duration of the ultrashort optical pulse. TACOS does not require optical carrier-envelope phase stability or working in vacuum, and it creates exciting avenues for ultrafast and highly efficient chiral sensing and manipulation.",

            "summary": "Ultrashort laser pulses pose unique tools to trigger and probe the fastest charge dynamics in matter, allowing the investigation of fundamental physical phenomena with unprecedented resolution in space, time, and energy. One of the most fascinating opportunities that ultrashort pulses offer is the possibility of modulating and investigating symmetries by tailoring the properties of the laser beam in the spatial and polarization domains, effectively controlling symmetry breaking on multiple levels. In particular, this allows probing chiral matter and ultrafast chiral dynamics. In recent years, the development of highly sensitive approaches for studying chirality has been a hot topic in physics and chemistry that has developed largely separately from the field of tailored light. This perspective discusses the individual and joint evolution of these fields with an emphasis on how the fields have already cross-fertilized, opening new opportunities in science. We outline a future outlook of how the topics are expected to fully merge and mutually evolve, emphasizing outstanding open issues.",

            "summary": "We introduce an ultrafast all-optical approach for efficient chiral recognition which relies on the interference between two low-order nonlinear processes which are ubiquitous in nonlinear optics: sum-frequency generation and third-harmonic generation. In contrast to traditional sum-frequency generation, our approach encodes the medium's handedness in the intensity of the emitted harmonic signal, rather than in its phase, and it enables full control over the enantiosensitive response. We show how, by sculpting the sub-optical-cycle oscillations of the driving laser field, we can force one molecular enantiomer to emit bright light while its mirror twin remains dark, thus reaching the ultimate efficiency limit of chiral sensitivity via low-order nonlinear light-matter interactions. Our work paves the way for ultrafast and highly efficient imaging and control of the chiral electronic clouds of chiral molecules using lasers with moderate intensities, in all states of matter: from gases to liquids to solids, with molecular specificity and on ultrafast timescales.",

            "summary": "Distinguishing between the left- and right-handed versions of a chiral molecule (enantiomers) is vital, but also inherently difficult. Traditional optical methods using elliptically or circularly polarized light rely on weak linear effects which arise beyond the electric-dipole approximation, posing major limitations for time resolving ultrafast chiral molecular dynamics. Here we show how, by tilting the plane of polarization of an ultrashort burst of intense elliptically polarized light, towards its propagation direction, we can turn the light field into a highly efficient chiro-optical tool. This \"forward tilting\" can be achieved by focusing the beam tightly, creating structured light which exhibits a nontrivial polarization pattern in space. We demonstrate that our structured field allows us to realize an interferometer for efficient chiral recognition that separates the nonlinear optical response of left- and right-handed molecules in space. Our work provides a simple, yet highly efficient, way of spatially structuring the polarization of light to image molecular chirality, with extreme enantio-sensitivity and on ultrafast time scales.",

            "summary": "Synthetic chiral light enables ultrafast and highly efficient imaging of molecular chirality. Unlike standard circularly polarized light, the handedness of synthetic chiral light does not rely on the spatial structure of the light field: it is encoded locally, in the chiral trajectory that the tip of the electric-field vector draws in time, at each point in space. Being locally chiral, already within the electric-dipole approximation, synthetic chiral light is a highly efficient chiral photonic reagent. Synthetic chiral light that is locally and globally chiral allows us to selectively quench the nonlinear response of a selected molecular enantiomer while maximizing it in its mirror twin at the level of total signal intensities. Synthetic chiral light that exhibits polarization of chirality allows us to realize a chiral version of Young's double-slit experiment that leads to enantio-sensitive light bending. Here we connect these two new concepts and show how one can structure the local and global handedness of synthetic chiral light in space, and how these local and global properties are imprinted in the enantio-sensitive response of the chiral molecules, creating new opportunities for ultrafast, all-optical and highly efficient imaging of molecular chirality.",

Bright HHG beams typically emerge from a longitudinal phased distribution of atomic-scale quantum antennae. Here, we form a transverse necklace-shaped phased array of HHG emitters, where orbital angular momentum conservation allows us to tune the line spacing and divergence properties of extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray high harmonic combs. The on-axis HHG emission has extremely low divergence, well below that obtained when using Gaussian driving beams, which further decreases with harmonic order. This work provides a new degree of freedom for the design of harmonic combs, particularly in the soft X-ray regime, where very limited options are available.

Here we introduce and experimentally validate a new class of light beams, whose unique property is associated with a temporal OAM variation along a pulse: the self-torque of light. Self-torque is a phenomenon that can arise from matter-field interactions in electrodynamics and general relativity, but to date, there has been no optical analog. In particular, the self-torque of light is an inherent property, which is distinguished from the mechanical torque exerted by OAM beams when interacting with physical systems. We demonstrate that self-torqued beams in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) naturally arise as a necessary consequence of angular momentum conservation in non-perturbative high-order harmonic generation when driven by time-delayed pulses with different OAM. In addition, the time-dependent OAM naturally induces an azimuthal frequency chirp, which provides a signature for monitoring the self-torque of high-harmonic EUV beams. Such self-torqued EUV beams can serve as unique tools for imaging magnetic and topological excitations, for launching selective excitation of quantum matter, and for manipulating molecules and nanostructures on unprecedented time and length scales.",

An attosecond pulse drives the excitations of an electronic wavepacket in water molecules. The process comprises two steps: a transition to core-excited states near the oxygen atoms accompanied by transition to valence-excited states. Thus, the wavepacket is impulsively created at a specific atomic site within a few hundred attoseconds through a nonlinear interaction between the water and the x-ray pulse. We observe this nonlinear signature in an intensity-dependent Stokes Raman sideband at 526 eV. Our measurements are supported by our state-of-the-art calculations based on the polarization response of water dimers in bulk solvation and propagation of attosecond x-ray pulses at liquid density.",

This work demonstrates that polarization control and characterization of high-harmonic generation provides an excellent ellipsometry tool that can fully retrieve both the amplitude and phase of a strong-field-driven dipole response. The polarization control of high-harmonic generation is realized by a transient nonlinear dipole grating coherently induced by two noncollinear counterrotating laser fields. By adjusting the ellipticity of the two driving pulses simultaneously, the polarization state of every high-harmonic order can be tuned from linear to highly elliptical, and it is fully characterized through an energy-resolved extreme ultraviolet polarimeter. From the analysis of the polarization state, the ellipsometry indicated that both the amplitude and phase of the high-harmonic dipole scale rapidly with the driving laser field for higher-order harmonics, and, especially, for gases with a small ionization potential. Our experimental results were corroborated by theoretical simulations. Our findings revealed a novel high-harmonic ellipsometry technique that can be used for the next generation of high-harmonic spectroscopy and attosecond metrology studies because of its ability to provide single-digit attosecond accuracy. Our work also paves the way to precisely quantify the strong-field dynamics of fundamental processes associated with the transfer of energy and angular momentum between electron/spin systems and the symmetry-dependent properties of molecules and materials.",

            "summary": "Ultrafast laser pulses generated at the attosecond timescale represent a unique tool to explore the fastest dynamics in matter. An accurate control of their properties, such as polarization, is fundamental to shape three-dimensional laser-driven dynamics. We introduce a technique to generate attosecond pulse trains whose polarization state varies from pulse to pulse. This is accomplished by driving high-harmonic generation with two time-delayed bichromatic counter-rotating fields with proper orbital angular momentum (OAM) content. Our simulations show that the evolution of the polarization state along the train can be controlled via OAM, pulse duration, and time delay of the driving fields. We, thus, introduce an additional control into structured attosecond pulses that provides an alternative route to explore ultrafast dynamics with potential applications in chiral and magnetic materials.",

In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.",

            "summary": "The strong-field induced generation of nonclassical states of light is not only a subject of fundamental research but also has potential usage in quantum information science and technology. The emerging field of strong-field quantum optics has developed ways of generating nonclassical states of light from the process of high-harmonic generation (HHG) at much wider frequency ranges and intensities than is typical for quantum optics. So far, however, no clear nonclassical signal at a distinct and unambiguous frequency has been predicted. Here, we study the response from an exciton in a Mott-insulating system, using the extended Hubbard model. We find that the exciton plays a key role in the nonclassical response and generates squeezing at the exciton energy. We relate this nonclassical response to the nonvanishing time correlations of the current operator in the system. Our work defines a direction for experimental work to search for squeezed light from HHG in a spectrally confined region defined by the exciton energy.",

Spin dynamics activated by the interchain hopping $t_y$ drastically modifies the HHG features. When two chains are decoupled ($t_y=0$), HHG originates from the dynamics of coherent doublon-holon pairs because of spin-charge separation. With increasing $t_y$, the doublon-holon pairs lose their coherence due to their interchain hopping and resultant spin-strings. Furthermore, the HHG signal from spin-polarons -- charges dressed by spin clouds -- leads to an additional plateau in the HHG spectrum. For large $t_y$, we identify unconventional HHG processes involving $three$ elementary excitations -- two polarons and one magnon. Our results demonstrate the nontrivial nature of HHG in strongly correlated systems, and its qualitative differences to conventional semiconductors.",

            "summary": "The spectra produced by high-harmonic generation (HHG) typically exhibit well-defined peaks at odd integers times the laser frequency. However, in recent investigations of HHG from correlated materials, spectra exhibit signals at noninteger harmonics which do not conform to the well-known symmetry-based selection rules for HHG-spectra. Here, we use the Fermi-Hubbard model to study HHG from a linear chain of atoms. This model allows us to study both the correlated and uncorrelated phases through a specification of the amount of onsite electron-electron repulsion. The presence of signal at noninteger harmonics can be interpreted as originating from the population of multiple Floquet states. We show how this coupling to different Floquet states depends on the characteristics of the driving pulse and the strength of the electron-electron interaction in the system.",

            "summary": "We study the effect of electron-electron correlations on the quantum state of the light emitted from high-harmonic generation (HHG). The quantum state of the emitted light is obtained by using a fully quantum mechanical description of both the optical modes as well as the electronic system. This is different from the usual semiclassical description of HHG, which only treats the electronic target system quantum mechanically. Using the generic Fermi-Hubbard model, the strength of the electron-electron correlation can be treated as a parameter enabling us to investigate the two limiting cases of a completely uncorrelated phase and a correlated Mott-insulating phase. In the completely uncorrelated phase, the model reduces to a single-band tight-binding model in which only intraband currents contribute to the spectrum. In this limit, we analytically find that the emitted light is in a classical coherent state. In the Mott-insulating phase, a consideration of the photon statistics and squeezing of the emitted photonic state shows that the inter-Hubbard-subband current generates nonclassical light. In this sense, we show that electron-electron correlation can induce the generation of nonclassical states of light.",

We simulate such imperfections by randomly modifying the chemical potential across the individual lattice sites. We control the degree of correlation by varying the Hubbard $U$. In the limit of vanishing $U$, this approach results in Anderson localization. For non-vanishing $U$, we explain the spectral observations using a qualitative picture in which correlation and the imperfections may balance each other out, causing Bloch-like transitions, i.e., transitions similar to those occurring in the case with small or vanishing $U$ and with vanishing imperfection-induced energy gaps, even though the dynamics take place under conditions of high $U$ and severe imperfections. We verify this picture by studying HHG spectra where imperfections are found to cause gain in the HHG spectra. The spectral gain is mainly in high harmonic orders for low correlation and low harmonic orders for high correlation. We explain this using the following qualitative picture. For low correlation, the addition of imperfections gives rise to significant energy gaps in the system, corresponding to high harmonics, and when the correlation is massive the addition of imperfections balances out the correlation, resulting in smaller energy gaps, meaning lower harmonic orders.\n  We further demonstrate how in the unbalanced cases, i.e., high $U$ and relatively small amount of imperfection or vice versa, the dynamics are largely adiabatic, and how in the balanced cases, with similar magnitude of correlation and imperfection, the dynamics are qualitatively similar.",

Doping is modeled by changing the number of electrons in the lattice from the conventional half-filling case. For relatively small Hubbard $U$, i.e., small electron-electron correlation, we find little to no effect of doping on the dynamics and the HHG spectra. For increasing $U$ the degree of doping has a marked effect on the dynamics and spectra. We explain these findings through the quasiparticle-based doublon-holon picture. The dynamics are separated into two types, firstly doublon and holon movement, and, secondly, doublon-holon pair creation and annihilation. Doping results in all configurations containing doublons or holons. Those quasiparticles can move at no extra cost in energy regardless of the correlation level. This motion at no energy cost increases the high-harmonic gain for low and medium harmonic orders. We discuss that in the high-$U$ limit, antiferromagnetic ordering becomes increasingly unlikely with increasing doping rates and explain an associated drop in the high-order harmonics relative to the case of half filling.",

A finite-size enhancement of the HHG signal is found and attributed to electrons backscattering off the lattice edges. Additionally, with increasing strength of the electron-electron correlation an enhancement of the high-frequency regime of the HHG spectrum is found. This is attributed to the on-site Coulomb repulsion between electrons giving rise to a localized quiver motion of the electrons. The finite-lattice enhancement dominates the HHG spectra from a few harmonic orders until a threshold from which the correlational enhancement dominates. This threshold is determined by the degree of correlation and decreases into the low-frequency regime for increasing electron-electron correlation. This infers that as the Mott insulator limit of high electron-electron correlation is approached, the finite-size effect on the electron dynamics becomes negligible.",

While the foundations of solid HHG have been established, a deep understanding into the nature of decoherence on sub-cycle timescales remains elusive. Furthermore, there is a growing need for tools to control ionization at the nanoscale. Here, we study HHG in silicon along a crystalline-to-amorphous (c-Si to a-Si) structural phase transition and observe a dramatic reshaping of the spectrum, with enhanced lower-order harmonic yield accompanied by quenching of the higher-order harmonics. Modelling the real-space quantum dynamics links our observations to a giant enhancement (>250 times) of tunnel ionization yield in the amorphous phase and a disorder-induced decoherence that damps the electron-hole polarization over approximately six lattice sites. HHG spectroscopy also reveals remnant order that was not apparent with conventional probes. Finally, we observe a rapid and targeted non-resonant laser annealing of amorphous silicon islands. Our results offer a unique insight into attosecond decoherence in strong-field phenomena, establish HHG spectroscopy as a probe of structural disorder, and pave the way for new opportunities in lightwave nanoelectronics.",

            "summary": "If we stack up two layers of graphene while changing their respective orientation by some twisting angle, we end up with a system that has striking differences when compared to single-layer graphene. For a very specific value of this twist angle, known as magic angle, twisted bilayer graphene displays a unique phase diagram that cannot be found in other systems. Recently, high harmonic generation spectroscopy has been successfully applied to elucidate the electronic properties of quantum materials. The purpose of the present work is to exploit the nonlinear optical response of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene to unveil its electronic properties. We show that the band structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is imprinted onto its high-harmonic spectrum. Specifically, we observe a drastic decrease of harmonic signal as we approach the magic angle. Our results show that high harmonic generation can be used as a spectroscopy tool for measuring the twist angle and also the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene, paving the way for an all-optical characterization of moir\\'e materials.",

            "summary": "The use of intense tailored light fields is the perfect tool to achieve ultrafast control of electronic properties in quantum materials. Among them, Mott insulators are materials in which strong electron-electron interactions drive the material into an insulating phase. When shinning a Mott insulator with a strong laser pulse, the electric field may induce the creation of doublon-hole pairs, triggering an insulator-to-metal phase transition. In this work, we take advantage of the threshold character of this insulator-to-metal transition and we propose a pump-probe scheme that consists of a mid-infrared laser pulse and a train of short pulses separated by half-period of the mid-infrared with alternating phases. By varying the time-delay between the two pulses and the internal carrier envelope phase of the short pulses, we achieve control of the phase transition, which leaves its fingerprint at its high harmonic spectrum.",

            "summary": "We study the expansion of a one-dimensional boson gas by suddenly increasing the length of the chain where it resides. We consider three initial ground-state configurations: the Mott insulator, the conventional superfluid clumped around zero momentum, and the cat-like state with peaks at momenta $\\pm \\pi/2$, resulting from rapid kinetic driving. In turn, we consider three types of expansion: spectroscopic (with interactions tuned to zero), dynamic (with standard short-range repulsive interactions) and under kinetic driving. The numerical calculations are exact. We compute the momentum- and real-space one-particle densities as well as the two-particle momentum correlations. The spectroscopic time-of-flight experiment faithfully reflects the initial momentum distribution. For the dynamic expansion starting from an insulator, we reproduce the non-equilibrium quasi-condensation into momenta $\\pm \\pi/2$ while noticing correlations in the momentum distribution, and provide an intuitive physical picture. A discussion of various measures of the momentum correlations is also presented.",
